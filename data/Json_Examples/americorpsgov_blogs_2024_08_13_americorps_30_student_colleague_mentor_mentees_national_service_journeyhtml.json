During the agency's 30th anniversary, we highlight how national service transformed the lives of those served and those who serve, like Jason and Nathan. AmeriCorps members serve as tutors and mentors in our nation's schools, helping students discover their potential to succeed in and out of the classroom. Jason and Nathan are a duo who demonstrate the power of national service in our schools and in our lives. Inspiring and Advancing Student Success Rates Jason's studies in political science and international studies at Northwestern University fueled his desire to create meaningful change in the world. \"I realized there was no greater way to make an impact than by becoming a teacher. I chose to serve with Teach For America as an AmeriCorps member to confront challenges in our community. Schools and opportunities are not always equitable, and I wanted to be part of the solution. The biggest challenge for my students, and many across the country, has never been their drive but rather the lack of opportunity. \"I see every day that our students are capable, intelligent, and eager to learn, but they need opportunities to surpass the expectations set for them. When I started teaching, our middle school didn't have an Algebra program because we lacked the data to justify offering high school-level courses even though these classes are common in more affluent schools across the country. I believed in my students' potential, so I offered the class after school to any student interested because of how important math is to our students. A student's math background is one of the most important predictors of whether they will graduate college in four years, regardless of their race, socioeconomic status, zip code, or parent education. \"I distributed flyers, spoke with families, and prepared for the first day for 20 students. When I opened the door, I was overwhelmed to see 86 students waiting outside, eager to take a voluntary Algebra class for two hours after school. Since then, more than 1,200 students at our school have earned Algebra credit, and more than 600 have earned both Algebra and Geometry credits. We've even had a handful of students complete Algebra, Geometry, and Algebra 2, making our program one of the most successful advanced middle school math programs in Phoenix, Ariz. Our Algebra students now make up the majority of the Calculus students across the entire Phoenix Union High School District, a district serving 28,000 students. This is why I stayed beyond my initial two-year Teach For America commitment. We were building something to help many more students realize their potential. Since I began teaching, I've seen firsthand how my students can accomplish anything they set their minds to. For the past 13 years, I've had the privilege of teaching many inspirational, intelligent, loving, and determined young men and women, like one of my first students and now, my colleague, Nathan. We believe that when students are given the opportunity, they will rise to meet high expectations and thrive. All they need are the opportunities to achieve their dreams.\" Previous Next Returning Gratitude through Service Nathan first met Jason as a teacher in the seventh grade. His mentorship inspired Nathan to join AmeriCorps with Teach For America and serve alongside him. \"When I met Mr. Catanese, I had almost no idea what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to help people. I'd always been interested in science, and at this point in my life, I was set on the medical field in some capacity. Had I not met Mr. Catanese, I would have had a drastically different trajectory. He helped me attend the best high school in Ariz., apply and succeed at Arizona State University with a degree in Healthcare Compliance and Regulations and a minor in Psychology, and encouraged me to apply for a Teach For America internship. Through this internship, I was able to recruit hundreds of prospective Americorps members, and became one myself upon graduation. \"As an AmeriCorps member, I taught eighth-grade science for two years and social studies for a year alongside my mentor, Mr. Catanese, at the school where I first met him. I believe I served as an example to my students as someone who was once in their shoes. Having been a student at the middle school when I was an AmeriCorps member, I met many students whose very own siblings were once my friends when I attended. I hope they can see the possibility of higher education as something attainable. \"As a teacher, I hope to instill a love of science and prompt curiosity about the wonders around them. I was filled with pride whenever I saw improvement in my students' assessments, quality of work, and so on, but most importantly, I am most proud of seeing my students become greater versions of themselves throughout the years. National service provided me, by far, one of the best opportunities to serve in the same community that I grew up in.\u201d Previous Next Creating Lasting Relations Beyond Service Jason and Nathan's journey is a testament to how national service leaves a positive impact on the lives of those served and those who serve. \"My life wouldn't be as fulfilling if I hadn't joined Teach For America,\" said Jason. \"I never would have met Nathan. I wouldn't have had the chance to learn strength and resilience from Eduardo, who showed me that a home is where love resides. I wouldn't have met Tania, who taught me the importance of simply showing up. Most importantly, I wouldn't have found my second family, who have inspired me not only to work hard every day as a teacher but also to start my nonprofit organization dedicated to helping students from inner-city backgrounds access college opportunities, Camp Catanese Foundation .\u201d Hundreds of thousands of AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers, like Jason and Nathan, serve our students in our schools every day to help them thrive in and out of the classroom. Through partnerships with the Department of Education and Johns Hopkins Everyone Graduates Center, national service continues to introduce initiatives like the National Partnership for Student Success to ensure we place caring adults in and out of schools to help educators and families address critical educational and mental health challenges in our schools.
