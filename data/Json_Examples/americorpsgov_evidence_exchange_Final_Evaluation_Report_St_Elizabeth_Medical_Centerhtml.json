This study looked at the implementation of the program and preliminary outcomes for treated patients compared to general patient data from St. Elizabeth emergency department (ED) facilities, where in-person mental healthcare is provided. The study found that: Training of employees for the program was completed and considered successful; The infrastructure for the program was adequate and ready; 98 percent of eligible patients consented to receive telepsychiatry services; The program increased the number of overall inpatient admissions by nearly 30 percent, but did not reduce the costs of mental healthcare in the ED; and Target groups found a significantly lover rate of return visits to the ED within 30 days and within 1 year. It should be noted that the proposed comparison group was not successfully matched, which affected the ability of the study to fully assess the impact.
