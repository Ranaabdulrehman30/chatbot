Each year, 60 AmeriCorps members fulfill their national service in this program as \u201cFamily Support Aides.\u201d The program provides primary prevention services to families who are at a high risk for child abuse and neglect. Study Goals : This summary report provides a process evaluation for two years of CWSI implementation. It focuses on four of the 14 participating counties that represent 30 member placements. The report includes performance measures that reflect program implementation, reach, and outcomes. Research Questions : The CWSI program collected data across multiple performance measures for the FY14/15 and FY15/16 program years. The research questions were: What were the specific intervention characteristics of the CWSI ASN program put into place to address families at high risk for child abuse and neglect? How well is the CWSI ASN program implemented with fidelity across program sites? Did the program intervention work in the achievement of a reduction in child abuse and neglect cases in the program site areas? Findings: The report found the following: Each of the CWSI sites found that the parenting education feature of the CWSI was a natural complement to their other existing services. More than half of the parents who received CWSI services reported a reduce in stress levels. Three-fourths of parents completing at least eight hours of the Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP), as well as having a pre- and post-program Adolescent Adult Parenting Inventory (AAPI) assessment, reported improved parenting knowledge and a reduction in risk behaviors. Eighty-five percent of parents completing the NPP program across the four sites had no County Child Welfare Systems (CWS/CPS) contact up to one year after completing their program.
