Honor. Unite. A Reality Submitted by mbrodbeck on Thu, 09/23/2021 - 09:45 Sep 23, 2021 AmeriCorps staff On 9/11 Day Americans helped turn a day of tragedy into a day of service, remembrance, and resilience for our nation. From coast to coast, thousands of Americans showed up in force to honor the 20th anniversary of September 11th. Through important service projects and remembrance activities, we were reminded of the unity that came from tragedy. Dozens of White House officials, including Secretary-level Cabinet Members, participated through service. Sending a huge #AmeriThanks to @SecGranholm for joining us to help make this #911Day all about serving others & doing good from coast to coast! #UnitedWeServe #NeverForget #September11 https://t.co/hebe30Wzqe \u2014 AmeriCorps (@AmeriCorps) September 11, 2021 And President Biden\u2019s annual proclamation specifically called on Americans to work with AmeriCorps to volunteer on this day of service. \u201cI encourage all Americans to visit americorps.gov/911-day to learn about and seek opportunities to serve others on this day and to demonstrate once again that the ideals we hold, which many have tried to attack and destroy, are the very bonds that hold us together \u2014 even tighter in times of peril.\u201d AmeriCorps members and volunteers also partnered with organizations across the nation to serve. In one partnership, AmeriCorps was thrilled to coordinate with Global Youth Justice on its first 911 Day Flag of Honor Across America Memorials . Volunteers distributed flags with 50 names of 9/11 victims to groups across the country to be read aloud. The ceremonies took place in 60 communities across 24 states, led and supported by 45 Youth Court Diversion Programs and AmeriCorps Seniors RSVP volunteers. Below is a slideshow of moving moments from inaugural ceremonies in New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Colorado. Previous Next In New York, Hannah, a current AmeriCorps member serving as Yemeni American Merchants Association\u2019s first VISTA fellow in New York City, created her own project writing more than 200 notes of appreciation to New York City Firefighters. \u201cThe whole point of this project is to honor those that we lost, those that we did not get to say thank you to before they lost their lives on 9/11/2001, by telling those that currently serve how appreciated they are,\u201d said Hannah. Hannah comes from a family of firefighters \u2013 from her great-great-grandfather to her brother \u2013 which inspired the idea for this remote service project. \u201cThe Fire Department lost 343 lives that day. Let\u2019s make sure the current firefighters of New York City know how thankful we are for them,\u201d she said. Those stories were just a small sample of the hundreds of service activities that took place this 9/11 Day. These service projects garnered news that we know will inspire others and continue to elevate service as a fitting tribute for 9/11.
