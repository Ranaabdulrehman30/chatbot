These leaders are made in AmeriCorps. \"It was my dream that one day I could be here and help people.\u201d As an AmeriCorps\u00a0member,\u00a0Fatemeh\u00a0is living her dream.\u00a0For the second time. After her family escaped from Afghanistan, Fatemeh arrived with her family to Albany, New York in 2019.\u00a0This year, Fatemeh begins her second summer as an AmeriCorps\u00a0VISTA Summer Associate\u00a0at\u00a0the Refugee Welcome Center \u2013 the same place that offered her family\u00a0support. Fatemeh\u2019s\u00a0service journey\u00a0with the Refugee Welcome Center is\u00a0not\u00a0by chance. It\u2019s exactly how\u00a0Vera\u00a0Eccarius-Kelly, Ph.D.\u00a0envisioned it. As the faculty mentor for the Siena Project Incubator,\u00a0one of Dr.\u00a0Eccarius-Kelly\u2019s goals is to impact the\u00a0life\u00a0trajectory\u00a0of\u00a0teenage,\u00a0resettled refugees\u2014particularly when it comes to attending college.\u00a0By\u00a0engaging\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0members like Fatemeh,\u00a0who are either\u00a0current or recent\u00a0college\u00a0students, she believes that preconceived notions young refugees have about the\u00a0limited\u00a0possibilities for their lives can be broken. \u201cWhen you have resettled refugees who are in the United States and they successfully enter college or graduate from college and then participate in these teams, that is a highly visual sign and message that goes out to the families that you can achieve in this country,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Eccarius-Kelly. At\u00a0the Siena Project Incubator ,\u00a0AmeriCorps members\u00a0work on projects that ultimately get\u00a0\u201cspun out\u201d\u00a0over the course of the school year with the help of students and volunteers. Last summer, an AmeriCorps\u00a0SPIn\u00a0project was initiated with the Refugee Welcome Center . The project has three important goals: resettle refugees to become members of the community;\u00a0spark social cohesion so community members get to know resettled refugees and feel confident that they are good neighbors;\u00a0and collect information about the specific needs newly arriving refugee families express. The AmeriCorps\u00a0SPIn\u00a0project is just one example of the ways\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0members are\u00a0using\u00a0their unique talents\u00a0and\u00a0skills for the betterment of the refugee\u00a0and\u00a0immigrant\u00a0communities.\u00a0The American story includes the story of families who ventured here \u2014\u00a0whether it\u00a0be\u00a0centuries ago, or\u00a0recently\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like Fatemeh\u2019s \u2014\u00a0from every part of the world\u00a0who continue to enrich the fabric of our nation.\u00a0And\u00a0AmeriCorps service exposes members to new experiences, people of diverse backgrounds and knowledge about their communities. Join with AmeriCorps to\u00a0celebrate the values\u00a0and opportunities\u00a0that immigrants bring to\u00a0communities around the\u00a0country\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and honor those core values\u00a0they share\u00a0that drive service every day. To those\u00a0like Fatemeh\u00a0who dream of helping people: AmeriCorps can make that a reality.
