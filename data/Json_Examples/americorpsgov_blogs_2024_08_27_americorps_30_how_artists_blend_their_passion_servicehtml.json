From poetry to music, AmeriCorps members and alumni of ArtistYear share their passion with the next generation through service. AmeriCorps programs like ArtistYear help students express their creativity while expanding opportunities for everyone to have access to arts education. A Poet's Journey to Education \"When I was in first grade, our class had a creative writing time, and one of the stations we could go to was called 'Choice Time.' My friend and I always made sure we were at that station at the same time so we could collaborate on stories together. It felt so imaginative and exciting to have the freedom to invent whatever we wanted,\" said AmeriCorps member Cat. \"A few years later, in fourth grade, my class was invited to write poetry about peace and submit our work to a local festival. From that experience, I developed an appreciation for the power of poetry to inspire deep reflection. \"After graduating with a bachelor's degree in English literature, I chose to serve with ArtistYear as an AmeriCorps member because I knew I was interested in the teaching profession, developing my creative writing practice, and serving my community. Bringing my passion for writing to students through service in Philadelphia, a city I already felt connected to, was a huge plus. By the end of my service year, I was grateful to witness my students see how far of a reach their voices can have. I saw them share their work with the class and their community and even submit to an international poetry contest. \"Arts education provides many opportunities for social-emotional learning, development of critical thinking skills, collaboration, community participation, and self-expression. Growing up, my public middle and high school didn't have opportunities in the arts, which is why any available program was all the more impactful. Through the drama class I attended, I learned a lot about what it means to make something with a community audience in mind and what being in deep collaboration with others looks like. Every student deserves access to these opportunities that will allow them to experiment, collaborate, and develop in these ways.\" Previous Next Empowering Students with Music \"If it weren't for the skills I gained through my AmeriCorps service, I wouldn't be where I am today in my career. Serving as a teaching artist with ArtistYear before getting my position in the classroom benefited me and my career as an educator immensely,\" said AmeriCorps alum Jamie. \"My passion for music stemmed from my first elementary music teacher. This music teacher had a beautiful way of igniting my passion for learning and the arts. Through her mentorship, I had the confidence to pursue music seriously. \"I chose to serve with ArtistYear because I believe the arts are something that all children should have access to, and my childhood dream was to be an educator. ArtistYear felt like the perfect way to utilize my skills for an organization whose mission I am deeply passionate about and gain experience. \"Through service, I was able to build connections beyond the classroom. I remember my fifth-grade student who had a deep passion for songwriting. Through weekly lunchtime musical collaboration, she wrote a song in honor of her uncle, who had recently passed away, and she performed it for the musical arts showcase. I went on to teach this student piano lessons for a while after she had graduated from elementary school, and I still think fondly of this student. \"Music education is a critical part of education as it provides an outlet for creativity. Music education utilizes and enhances cognitive development, linguistics and critical thinking skills, leadership building, collaboration, and more. I have seen firsthand the impact of music education and how it has the power to build confidence and transform lives.\" The National Service Movement to Student Success From early education to high school, AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers like Cat and Jamie have served to help guide students to graduation and prepare them for higher education, careers, and life. Whether it's improving students' literacy and numeracy skills, building social-emotional skills and supporting students' mental health, or ensuring all students have access to arts education, the national service movement empowers students to reach their full potential and succeed beyond the classroom.
