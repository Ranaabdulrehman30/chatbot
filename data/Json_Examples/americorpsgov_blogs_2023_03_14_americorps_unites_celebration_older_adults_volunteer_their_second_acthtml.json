Every day, AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers\u2019 commitment makes a positive impact on their community, transforming the lives of those they serve: For more than 50 years , AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers in the RSVP program get things done across the nation from managing volunteers, helping serve at food banks, and providing disaster awareness. Volunteers serving in the Senior Companion program befriend older adults and assist with daily living tasks such as transportation to appointments, cooking meals, and more to allow them to better maintain independence and age with dignity. Through the Foster Grandparents program , one of AmeriCorps Seniors\u2019 oldest programs, volunteers connect with children, students, and younger adults, taking on pivotal roles to help shape future generations. AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers serving in the Foster Grandparent program Volunteers are essential AmeriCorps uniters , helping people in their communities recover from the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. From supporting food banks to conducting check-ins with isolated older adults, volunteers stepped in to lift up our communities during unprecedented times. Foster Grandparents united in service to combat learning loss, answering President Biden\u2019s call for 250,000 more tutors and mentors to accelerate student recovery and success. Lifting up the community through soup kitchens AmeriCorps Seniors volunteer Jim Kowalski has been serving with the RSVP program for more than a decade. After retiring as a behavioral health counselor, Jim decided to become a volunteer to give back in his new free time. Jim joined the Soup Kitchen of Greater Wheeling in Ohio, making more than 10,000 hoagies for community members in need. He says the greatest thing about volunteering at the soup kitchen is meeting people and socializing. It\u2019s a place where those in need can sit down and enjoy a hot meal as a community.

After immigrating, he settled into the Hmong community in Missoula. He worked with community members and served on the board of the Refugee Assistance Center until it closed, and in 2011, he joined the Senior Companion program with Serve Montana to continue helping those who needed his assistance. Since then, he\u2019s served nearly 14,000 hours and logged more than 24,000 miles helping others. Chue provides translation services to help others communicate with their healthcare providers, complete important medical forms, and live healthier lives as a Senior Companion.
