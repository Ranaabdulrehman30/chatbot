Charity frequented Pulse.\u00a0It was a place where she would go to dance and celebrate graduations, birthdays, and\u00a0life\u2019s\u00a0other milestones. When the tragedy happened\u00a0she\u00a0wasn\u2019t at the club, she\u00a0was serving\u00a0in AmeriCorps\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0VISTA member with the City of Orlando. But she soon found herself back in the spot that used to\u00a0be filled with happy memories. Charity,\u00a0along with a team of AmeriCorps members,\u00a0stood up the Family Assistance Center at Camping World Stadium to\u00a0help family,\u00a0friends\u00a0and staff\u00a0with the immediate fallout from the\u00a0deadly\u00a0attack.\u00a0Nearly 30 AmeriCorps members, including those serving through programs administered by Volunteer Florida and the Mayor\u2019s office, were assigned to the Family Assistance Center in Orlando.\u00a0Together, they\u00a0coordinated\u00a0donation\u00a0management, referrals to social service providers, language translation, funeral arrangements, counseling, towing services for cars of the deceased left at the club, legal aid, and\u00a0anything else survivors needed. Charity helped family members of\u00a0survivors\u00a0who\u00a0were\u00a0recovering in the hospital\u00a0find\u00a0local\u00a0places\u00a0to stay and transportation to\u00a0and from the hospital. She also\u00a0rehomed\u00a0a dog\u00a0whose\u00a0owner died in the shooting. \u201cServing in AmeriCorps showed me how a group of people, committed to helping others, can drive real change for a community in need,\u201d said Charity.\u00a0\u201cWe, as AmeriCorps\u00a0members, did all of these\u00a0little things\u00a0that added up to\u00a0be\u00a0huge supports\u00a0for those affected by the tragedy and for the City of Orlando as whole.\" Today,\u00a0Charity is proud to be an important part of the community\u2019s healing process. Even more, as\u00a0an\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0team, they\u00a0looked to one another to heal\u00a0from the tragedy.\u00a0They picked each other up; they\u00a0offered shoulders to\u00a0cry on.\u00a0And they never backed away from their\u00a0oath to strengthen their community, to\u00a0get things done \u2013 no matter how difficult. This power \u2013 to take action, to persevere, to bring Americans together \u2013 is at the core of what it means to be an AmeriCorps member. AmeriCorps provides strong support, expertise, and trained and dedicated volunteers to help communities recover from crisis. The center\u00a0created\u00a0in Orlando\u00a0was relocated from the Camping World Stadium, but\u00a0still focuses on survivors, their chosen family, and families of those\u00a0devastated\u00a0by the tragedy. It continues to evolve as well. Recently, the center\u2019s service curriculum was adopted by The Center Orlando, an organization dedicated to serving Central Florida\u2019s LGBTQ+ community. This Pride Month,\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0honors\u00a0those who lost their lives, and those who witnessed\u00a0such tragedy.\u00a0The work isn\u2019t done\u2014not in Orlando and not in communities around the country.\u00a0No one should face discrimination or live in fear because of who they are or whom they love.\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0members\u00a0partner each day\u00a0with communities to address systemic challenges and\u00a0break\u00a0down barriers.\u00a0During Pride Month, AmeriCorps stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Americans in the march\u00a0toward\u00a0full\u00a0equality. #WhatsAtYourCore?
