AmeriCorps members are placed in schools and community sites across Minnesota where they are assigned Focus Lists of up to 30 qualifying students, who are in grades 6 through 12 and off track to graduate. Members work with teams including teachers, school administrators, parents, school social workers, and community partners to identify and work directly with students with low school attendance, low work completion, and/or low school engagement. Study Goals : The goal of the study is to evaluate the impact of the Alliance\u2019s AmeriCorps Promise Fellow Program on the program\u2019s qualifying students. Research Questions : The research questions were: To what extent do students served by the Alliance demonstrate greater increases in: monthly attendance relative to other students who do not qualify to be served, but are close to the cut-off? pre-post engagement relative to other students who do not qualify to be served, but are close to the cut-off? monthly work completion relative to other students who qualify to be served, but are close to the cut-off? Findings: The evaluation found that the Focus List students demonstrated improvements in the three key outcome areas, as students in the control group showed declines: Attendance: Focus List students increased attendance, while students in the control group decreased attendance. Focus List students decreased tardiness by nearly one-fifth between the baseline and final benchmark periods. Most Focus List students saw reductions in their individual tardiness rates: 69 percent of Focus List students decreased their individual tardiness between the benchmark and baseline periods. Engagement: Focus List students significantly improved their engagement over the course of the school year. Work Completion: Focus List students significantly increased work completion over the course of the year, while Control group students\u2019 work completion decreased slightly: 45 percent of Focus List students increased their work completion between the baseline and final benchmark. Focus List students are expected to complete nearly 6 percent more homework between the baseline and final benchmark. For more information, download the full report .
