These FOCs provide three main services: financial counseling, employment assistance, and assistance accessing public benefits to supplement income from work. The Economic Mobility Corporation conducted a quasi-experimental design study to compare program participant outcomes at five centers in Chicago to those of a similar group of job seekers who sought assistance from the city's workforce centers. They also conducted an implementation study. Research questions focused primarily on employment and income outcomes two years after program entry. The study found that FOC participants, compared to the comparison group: Were significantly more likely to be employed year-round Showed significantly greater positive impact in credit scores Did not show statistically significant improvement in income and net worth In short, the\u00a0program demonstrated positive impact on participant financial stability, but not financial gain within the two years studied.
