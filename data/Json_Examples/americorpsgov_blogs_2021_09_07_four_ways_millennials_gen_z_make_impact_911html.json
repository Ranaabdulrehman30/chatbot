Arion shares below ways she and other young adults can find a role in honoring those lost on 9/11 Day. Join AmeriCorps on 9/11 Day to give back to your community in any way you can. Get involved, whether it\u2019s through volunteering, teaching in the classroom, or taking a moment out of the day to spread the word. Below are four ways you can honor, serve, and unite this 9/11 Day. 1. Create your own project. We have a list of resources available for you to create your own service project on 9/11 Day: Collect school supplies and deliver them to a local school Sign up to serve or deliver meals to those at risk of hunger 911day.org is partnering with World Kitchen to deliver as many as 200,000 meals to first responders, healthcare workers, veterans, and those who are food insecure. Beautify a local park or community space - fall is a good time to plant trees and spring blooming bulbs Arrange a visit to a senior citizen center or send cards to residents/clients of a senior center Check with your local fire station and see if you can organize a fall clean up or serve them a meal Arrange a visit to a veterans\u2019 center. You can also check with the center to see if they need personal care items and launch a collection drive. 2. Reach out and spread the word. Spread the word on social by engaging with @AmeriCorps and @911Day by commenting and sharing posts from accounts to encourage others to honor the 20th anniversary by #DoingGood and serving others using our graphics and copy found in our social press kit to create your own posts posting our \u201cI Will Serve\u201d graphic and pinning it to your Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn profile to share that you\u2019ll be serving and urging your loved ones and community members to do the same. 3. Check in on someone who might be isolated or lonely During the pandemic, many have become increasingly isolated. On 9/11 Day, you can check in on your neighbor. It can be something simple as sending out a quick text message or helping them with their daily house chores. 4. Visit the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Honor the lives of those who were killed in the 2001 attack as you learn about the personal stories of the victims, the families, and survivors who deal with the aftermath. Located at the World Trade Center in New York City, the 9/11 Memorial Museum tells the story through media, narratives, and a collection of monumental and authentic artifacts, presenting visitors with personal stories of loss, recovery, and hope. The museum is open with new health and safety measures in place . On 9/11 Day, you can find a way to serve or do just one good deed. If we all do, those deeds add up. Help us find ways to honor and celebrate the lives affected can make a positive difference this September 11th.
