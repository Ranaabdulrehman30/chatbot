And ask you to continue to help our fellow citizens. So many of you have stepped up since March 2020 to support your communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, whether through direct service with AmeriCorps or additional volunteering you have participated in your communities\u2014or both. Our country would not be where it is today on the road to recovery without your help. Thank you. Through your partnership with AmeriCorps and your work in communities, you know that it takes a team effort to solve problems and make a lasting difference. Yesterday, President Biden announced a National Vaccine Month of Action to ensure 70 percent of U.S. adults have at least one shot by July 4th. He made clear every American has a part to play in this critical effort, and already volunteers, organizations, businesses, and local government leaders have joined in. Working together with your support, we believe we can accomplish this goal. Your commitment to service is a testament to that\u2014and your commitment to getting things done is still needed. I invite you to join the COVID-19 Community Corps National Vaccine Month of Action (June 4-July 4), and help us reach this important milestone. Participating in this national effort is easy. Simply commit to hosting or participating in an event \u2013 calling or texting family and friends, hosting a local canvass, making calls to areas with lower vaccination rates \u2013 that shows people how, when, and where they can get vaccinated. You can sign up by clicking \u201cTake Action.\u201d You also will have access to resources to assist in outreach, trainings, and more. Are you already hosting an event?\u00a0Do you need more volunteers? You can add your event so others can join you. Together, we can help Americans build back better safely and in good health.
