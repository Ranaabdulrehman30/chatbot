Since its inception, AmeriCorps has been a government corporation that invests limited federal dollars to leverage substantial private investment to improve lives and communities , enabl ing the agency to build strong public-private partnerships and relationships with businesses, foundations, and other partners . As we celebrate our milestones, we shed light on our partners\u2019 contributions and commitment to supporting AmeriCorps\u2019 mission and empowering Americans to strengthen our communities. Hitting Home Runs Through Service Major League Baseball\u2019s New York Yankees launched HOPE Week in 2009 to recognize Americans who step up for their community, rooted in the fundamental belief that acts of goodwill provide hope and encouragement to more than just the recipient of the gesture . And every year since AmeriCorps has joined the Yankees HOPE Week to present the President\u2019s Volunteer Service Award to exceptional volunteers and honor Americans whose service positively impacts communities in every corner of the nation and inspires others to act. But HOPE Week has also been a chance to make dreams come true. In 2021, Gwen \u2013 a Yankees fan of more than 60 years and a social worker in Connecticut\u2019s Westport school system for more than three decades \u2013 fulfilled her dreams from when she was 10 years old during HOPE Week . Gwen wrote a letter to the Yankees\u2019 front office expressing her dream of being a bat girl and while her original request was declined, she was honored to take the mound to throw the first pitch and serve as bat girl for the night. A dream 60 years in the making. Yesterday, we kicked off #HOPEWeek by honoring Gwen Goldman as our honorary bat girl. pic.twitter.com/067KQOC8gF New York Yankees (@Yankees) June 29, 2021 Creating Healthier Communities In 2022, AmeriCorps partnered with t he Home Depot Foundation to assist Up With Trees with a citywide tree planting effort to revitalize major roadways throughout Tulsa , Okl a . The partnership helped address the effects of the several hundreds of trees lost due to the unseasonably hot and dry summers . Through philanthropic efforts, the new plantings increase biodiversity throughout the city and provide a wide variety of species to support diversification, strengthening the hardiness of Tulsa\u2019s trees. AmeriCorps NCCC team helping plant trees with the Home Depot and Up With Trees The cleanup and replanting project completed by AmeriCorps NCCC teams and volunteers helped create a safer and healthier place for passersby traveling throughout Tulsa and the neighboring communities . F or six week s, AmeriCorps members and volunteers from Tulsa and t he Home Depot planted more than 700 trees to decrease noise pollution from traffic, increase shade, and absorb gaseous pollutants. To ensure the longevity of these combined efforts, today, Up With Trees continues to water, warranty, and maintain these trees to ensure their proper establishment and health. Spotlighting Future Leaders of Public Service Our partners\u2019 commitment also relies on how our missions are aligned. The mission of the Schultz Family Foundation , a longtime AmeriCorps partner, is to create greater opportunity, accessible to all Americans. S imilar to how AmeriCorps aims to reduce barriers to service . Through funding initiatives like t he National Service Challenge , the Schultz Family Foundation\u00a0partners and invests in\u00a0programs that expand service\u00a0and economic mobility\u00a0opportunities, especially for underrepresented young adults in underserved communities. Through these investments, AmeriCorps and State Service Commissions can\u00a0fund innovative solutions to community challenges through service\u00a0and\u00a0provide support and capacity for nonprofits\u00a0while creating service-to-career opportunities for the young adults who serve. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Schultz Family Foundation (@schultzfamilyfdn) Helping Spread the Word For 30 years, AmeriCorps has been an essential nonprofit and community partner that invests in programs to help improve lives, strengthen communities, and foster civic engagement through national service and volunteering.
