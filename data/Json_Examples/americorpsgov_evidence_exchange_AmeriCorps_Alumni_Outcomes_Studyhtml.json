Findings from this study will help CNCS and other interested stakeholders answer the following three core research questions: In what ways does participating in a national service program influence members\u2019 career pathways, civic engagement, development of career-oriented soft and hard skills, and sense of community? What are the post-secondary and employment outcomes of AmeriCorps alumni, and does national service serve as a pathway to post-secondary and/or employment success? Through surveying 3772 alumni, and a secure data match with the National Student Clearinghouse, the study found that: AmeriCorps service is found to have a significant positive effect on civic engagement; respondents were more likely to engage in all community service activities asked about in the survey post-AmeriCorps compared to pre-AmeriCorps. There was also a positive effect seen on sense of community, cultural competency and measures of self-efficacy. AmeriCorps service had significant effects on alumni\u2019s employment and career pathways. For example, AmeriCorps alumni are more likely to attain a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher than the average American adult.
