National service helps promote equity by creating economic opportunities and building job-ready skills through hands-on experiences and apprenticeships. In the past decade, active youth apprenticeships increased by more than 118 percent. Organizations, employers, educators, labor unions, workforce professionals, and their partners across the country are launching registered apprenticeship programs every day that allow youth to earn competitive wages while obtaining the relevant training and experience to start their careers. In recognition of this growing area of workforce development, the Department of Labor is proud to host the first-ever Youth Apprenticeship Week , a nationwide celebration to highlight the benefits and value of registered apprenticeship programs for young adults. Apprenticeship in AmeriCorps Programs AmeriCorps member serving in an apprenticeship program AmeriCorps programs across the country are finding innovative ways to combine service with pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship programs to provide members with opportunities to build skills and gain experiences that will benefit them long beyond their service term. AmeriCorps and registered apprenticeship both have rules and regulations developed and maintained by federal and state agencies, but combining the two programs leverage the benefits to both the members serving and the communities they serve. The AmeriCorps Digital Service Fellows Pre-Apprenticeship Program engages recent Philadelphia, Pa., high school graduates interested in information technology careers in a full year of service supporting student and school technology needs and learning about the information technology field. AmeriCorps members serve directly with the school district\u2019s technology professionals. Members\u2019 experience is supplemented with training toward industry-standard certifications, including Dell Technician Certification, Apple Certified Macintosh Technician, CompTIA A+, Google Apps for Education Certification, and more. After they complete their service, AmeriCorps members also have the opportunity to apply to and engage in a registered apprenticeship program that directly connects to their service experience. Through the Colorado Public Health Works Program , Community Health Workers serve where the need is greatest, such as at local public health agencies, hospitals, community health clinics, and other community-based organizations. Community Health Workers apprentices are AmeriCorps members enrolled in the US Department of Labor registered apprenticeship program. During their apprenticeship and service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Patient Navigator Training Collaborative provide members with certificates and competencies through in-person, instructor-led, and online courses to support the next generation of public health leaders.
