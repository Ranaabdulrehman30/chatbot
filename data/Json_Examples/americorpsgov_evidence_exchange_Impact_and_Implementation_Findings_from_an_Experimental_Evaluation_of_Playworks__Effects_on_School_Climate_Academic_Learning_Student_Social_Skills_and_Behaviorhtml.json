The primary purpose of this evaluation was to document the implementation of Playworks and assess the impact of the program on key outcomes in five areas: school climate, conflict resolution and aggression, learning and academic performance, youth development, and student behavior The study found that the program was implemented as intended in 8 out of 17 schools, and implemented with some variation in 6 of the 17 schools. For the impact on school climate there was positive impact on \u00a0students who demonstrated as increase in the use of encouraging language, while there were improvements in the perceptions of student\u2019s safety and engagement in inclusive behavior at recess.
