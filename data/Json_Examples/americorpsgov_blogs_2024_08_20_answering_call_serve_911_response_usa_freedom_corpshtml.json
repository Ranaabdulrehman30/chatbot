In the days, weeks, and months following the attacks, hundreds of thousands of people in the United States and allied nations felt a patriotic calling to serve their country and help our nation recover. AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers were among those who stepped forward to help, offering emergency assistance to the injured, serving as family caseworkers, and helping those displaced from Ground Zero find housing and other services. These acts of service by millions paved the way for President George W. Bush's USA Freedom Corps , which encouraged Americans to unite for good by serving our neighbors and nation and harnessing the American spirit of volunteerism by enhancing homeland security efforts, increasing community-based service opportunities, and investing in service opportunities abroad to aid people around the world. A National Call to Service During his State of the Union address, President George W. Bush announced how the administration would provide additional community-based service opportunities, recruit more than 200,000 AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers, and remove barriers to service. \"We know that out of tragedy, strength and hope and even good can come. One of the best ways to counter evil is through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness,\" said President George W. Bush. \"Our great challenge now is to encourage this outpouring of service and civic pride \u2013 and to harness it to a great national purpose. This is the underlying principle of the USA Freedom Corps.\" In its seven-year duration, the USA Freedom Corps had more than one million volunteers \u2013 raising the national volunteering rates to a historic high. President Bush's call to service expanded beyond the establishment of the USA Freedom Corps. In the years following his 2002 State of the Union address, the number of AmeriCorps members increased by 62 percent. Members engaged in service activities like mentoring youth and improving academic performance, responding to natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, expanding the capacity of more than 70,000 organizations to meet local community needs, and providing independent living support to almost 500,000 disabled and elderly people. This outpour of volunteerism showcased the enthusiasm with which Americans answered this call to service and their unwavering compassion and commitment to helping a neighbor in need. A Lifetime of Service With the USA Freedom Corps, President Bush also established the President\u2019s Volunteer Service Award in 2003 through the President\u2019s Council on Service and Civic Participation to recognize volunteers\u2019 commitment and dedication to our communities. Since its inception, AmeriCorps and Points of Light have recognized volunteers whose service positively impacts communities and inspires those around them to take action, too. For many, the 9/11 Day attacks were a life-changing experience that sparked a lifetime of service. Their lives may have been marked by national tragedy, but from their shared experience, they learned lessons of unity, compassion, and commitment. \"My time with AmeriCorps and the 9/11 attacks made me commit a lifetime of service. The experience impacted my worldview and how it defined what it is to be an American,\" said Brendan Butler, AmeriCorps alumni who served with AmeriCorps VISTA at the American Red Cross and was deployed to Ground Zero in the 9/11 Day aftermath. Like Brendan, national service has been a pathway for many Americans to find their passion and careers for the past 30 years. Many AmeriCorps alums who served in the aftermath of the 9/11 Day attacks have pursued careers as doctors, teachers, nonprofit organization leaders, advocates, emergency responders, and more. Get Involved this 9/11 Day of Service This year, join AmeriCorps on the 9/11 National Day of Service and Remembrance and gather with your community to make a difference. By helping rekindle the spirit of unity that arose in the days immediately following the 9/11 tragedy, you can spark a lifetime of volunteering, civic engagement, and giving back. Whether you plan on cleaning up a public space, mentoring a young person, training tutors, assisting those who are food insecure or unhoused, or through other acts of service, what you do makes a world of difference. On 9/11 Day and every day, help our communities thrive and meet urgent needs by answering America's call to service in times of tragedy and triumph.
