From young adults to retired older adults, AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors from coast to coast make a difference in their community every day. AmeriCorps Week celebrates and thanks those who previously and currently wear the AmeriCorps \u2018A\u2019 across the nation. AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers unite in service to address unique needs, help children thrive in and out of the classroom, assist older adults to live independently, fight hunger, support veterans and military families, combat climate change, support disaster relief and recovery, and improve public health. More than one million Americans donned the AmeriCorps \u2018A\u2019 For nearly 30 years, Americans dedicated their time and skills to help lift up our nation\u2019s communities through AmeriCorps. Former President Bill Clinton helped launch AmeriCorps in 1994 after signing the National and Community Service Trust Act, swearing in the first class of 20,000 AmeriCorps members. Former President Bill Clinton meeting AmeriCorps members (Photo credit Clinton Foundation ) Today, more than 200,000 members and AmeriCorps Seniors serve in nearly 40,000 locations with more than 1.2 million alumni whose commitment to service has helped and inspired new generations of civic engagement. Members showcasing their AmeriCorps \u2018A\u2019 Join with the national service community to celebrate the 2023 Day of the A on Thursday, March 16. Show off your AmeriCorps pride by sharing on social media images from your service term, your favorite AmeriCorps gear, or your most creative A art project. Giving AmeriThanks for making a difference Throughout the week, AmeriCorps members and volunteers making a positive impact in their community will take center stage on all agency channels. Whether they serve for one year or become a lifeline volunteer, these Americans make good things happen: AmeriCorps members serving in the NCCC program protect millions of acres of land, improve parks and public lands, and create the next generation of conservation and climate resilience leaders; AmeriCorps members in FEMA Corps served on more than 80 federally declared disasters across 31 states and territories since its inception 10 years ago; AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers share their life skills to tutor and mentor children, befriend fellow older adults, and help community members in need; AmeriCorps members serving in the VISTA program address poverty, fight hunger, and support healthy futures in their community; Veterans choose to continue to serve their nation through national service, help engage their fellow service members and their families before, during, and after their tours of duty; and AmeriCorps members serve with Public Health AmeriCorps , an initiative in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to address their community\u2019s public health needs and health inequities. AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith (left) with members during AmeriCorps Week 2022 As a nation, we witnessed unprecedented challenges that affected our schools, mental health, livelihood, and safety. President Biden called on Americans to unite through service and help put forward a shared vision for a more united America. AmeriCorps \u201cuniters\u201d prove every day that service can unite people regardless of race, religion, or background.
