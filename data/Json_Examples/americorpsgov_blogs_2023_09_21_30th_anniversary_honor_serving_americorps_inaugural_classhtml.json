I was 18 years old and had just graduated from high school when President Bill Clinton announced the creation of AmeriCorps in 1993. I jumped at the chance to join the inaugural class of AmeriCorps members because I wasn\u2019t quite ready to go to college. Not only this but my life was framed around service. My parents and my biggest hero, Muhammad Ali, were my inspiration to join the inaugural class. My parents were firm believers in serving others. They volunteered with local nonprofits in our hometown and taught me that leadership is shown through my actions, not just my words. Muhammad Ali\u2019s compassion for others and desire for peace have always driven me to serve and make a difference. My decision to join AmeriCorps also stemmed from knowing that this was an opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and challenge myself. For 18 years, I had never lived outside my home state of Kentucky. I thought AmeriCorps would be a unique experience to meet new people, travel, and serve my country. And it was. The Startup of Service Serving in the inaugural class was a pivotal point that changed the course of my life from the moment I raised my hand and took the pledge. AmeriCorps had the feel of a modern-day startup. Our leadership team was strong, and they empowered the members to be engaged in constructive criticism and think about the best ways to accomplish our shared mission. We created new processes to learn the best way to work with each other and complete our tasks. Not all our ideas were successful, but it was exciting to be part of a program that was new and find ways to work together without the experience from previous years. We all gathered for the right reasons \u2013 we all wanted to make a difference in our communities. This is why my service with AmeriCorps NCCC was an extraordinary experience despite the challenges of being a brand-new team. Serving alongside a group of individuals from different walks of life every day, you learn how to work with each other live in harmony and serve the greater good. Rob\u2019s inaugural class serving in 1994. I was honored to receive the \u201cMost Inspirational Corps Member\u201d award from my team during my service. This moment holds a special place in my heart because my team members nominated me for bringing kindness and joy to our work. I strongly believe that there are no obstacles that we cannot overcome as long as we work together. But the most memorable moment from my service was when our team joined the Red Cross in New Orleans, La., to support disaster recovery efforts after the Great Flood in 1995. Our team distributed needed supplies to survivors and served meals in the community after people lost their homes to the flood. Though the circumstances were challenging, I fell in love with the community, culture, and people of that special place. We were in New Orleans for six weeks and it made an impact on me. So much so that I returned to serve the community 10 years later. In 2005, I served to help community members after Hurricane Katrina devastated communities and volunteered to support recovery efforts following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 . Finding My Future Through Service AmeriCorps was truly a life-changing year for me. My goals as a teen were to earn a business degree and expand my family\u2019s restaurant. I dreamed of being a famous chef, restaurateur, and hotel owner in the Caribbean. When I returned from AmeriCorps, I was forever changed.\u00a0 While I managed my family\u2019s restaurant, I started a community garden. The calling to serve was there. I left to finish college, worked in local and state government, and then eventually moved to the West to manage AmeriCorps programs in Utah and the Mountain Region Office . AmeriCorps altered the course of my life and led me to a career in public service, social justice, economic development, and corporate social responsibility. Inaugural class of AmeriCorps members, including Rob, in 1994 Choose Service to Experience Life Through AmeriCorps, I learned service opens our perspectives and allows us to experience different opportunities, personalities, and cultures. There are eight billion people in the world, different communities, and various ways in which people find happiness through connection. Listening to others and serving others is the best way to learn empathy and true compassion. I\u2019m proud to say that I was one of the first Americans to join AmeriCorps. It\u2019s inspiring to see the growth of national service over the past 30 years, and it\u2019s exciting to see how AmeriCorps has evolved. I encourage all young people in America to consider service with AmeriCorps to expand their horizons and become the true leaders of our nation . Happy 30th anniversary, AmeriCorps, and thank you for helping me find my purpose.
