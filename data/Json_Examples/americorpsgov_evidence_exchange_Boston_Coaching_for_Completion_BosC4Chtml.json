These groups partnered together to focus on boosting college persistence and ultimately improving college completion rates for Boston\u2019s public school graduates. The program\u2019s one-on-one transition coaching model offers sustained, responsive, and proactive support for students in their first two years of college. The coaching is provided through local non-profits. Study Goals : The goals of the study are to focus on interim impacts of the study, discover the effect of Success Boston Coaching (SBC) on student success in college (persistence, cumulative credits, GPA, and FAFSA renewal), and identify what student or coaching factors may be associated with those effects. Research Questions : The research questions were: What is the effect of coaching on the following key outcomes: annual persistence, grade point average (GPA), academic standing, Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) completion, and postsecondary completion? What is the nature of variation in the impacts of coaching for student outcomes? How is the observed variation associated with student characteristics, such as gender and race/ethnicity? How is the observed variation associated with features of the coaching, including dosage and topics covered? How is SBC implemented across partner organizations and partner colleges? How do the coaching models vary across partner organizations? How do the coaching and support services provided vary by college? What resources are necessary to implement SBC and to achieve desired student outcomes? Findings: The report found the following: SBC-coached students were five percent more likely to persist into the second year of college. After two years of college, SBC students had seven percent more credits accumulated. Coached students were eight percent more likely to renew their FAFSA. Also, the students with the most interaction seemed to have the best success rates in persistence, achievement, and FAFSA renewal. For more information, download the full report and report brief .
