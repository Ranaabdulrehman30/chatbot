Julia Hillengas, co-founder and executive director of PowerCorpsPHL, spoke with Jaiden about why he chose to come to PowerCorpsPHL and what he found most valuable about his experience. He kept coming back to this idea of the power, the beauty, and the peace that comes from \u201ccompleting the cycle\u201d. In Jaiden\u2019s words: \"I was applying to jobs but not getting any. I didn\u2019t have any experience and my time management was not very good. I knew I would be graduating high school soon, but I wasn\u2019t sure what I was supposed to do next. My older sister had been through PowerCorpsPHL and thought it would be good for me. She told me all about it. She helped me apply and get to my interview on time. I used to watch television, be on my phone a lot, and play video games. Now, I barely play video games at all. Being outside, being in nature, it just feels good; everything around you is beautiful. It\u2019s just so enjoyable that it elevates you as a person. At PowerCorpsPHL, I improved my time management, and I was drawn to being able to learn hands-on. I love learning about ecosystems and trees. How ecosystems live and thrive and knowing why is just amazing. And then we get to be a part of it. For example, we plant a lot of trees in PowerCorpsPHL. Those trees take up carbon dioxide, give us oxygen to breathe, food to eat, and they complete this cycle that we need. We then get the beauty of the plants, rivers, fresh air, and that makes us feel good. If we want that feeling, then we must do our part in the cycle to keep the Earth, trees, and us healthy. When we do that, we make beauty. We make peace. Those are the things we need more of.\" Jaiden and team teaching about chainsaw use to to a new crew Jaiden joins more than 1.2 million AmeriCorps alumni who found their passion, and developed life skills, while serving in communities around the country.
