A sense of shared responsibility is woven into the fabric of our nation. For decades, our agency has engaged people of all ages and backgrounds in getting things done - improving lives, strengthening communities, and expanding opportunity. Today, service is needed more than ever. To meet current and future challenges, it is essential that more individuals know how they can serve their communities and country. But all too often, the public doesn\u2019t know what national service is, the benefits, or how to get involved. That\u2019s why we are taking steps to increase awareness and ensure more people know about opportunities to serve. Starting today, our agency will begin operating under the name AmeriCorps. Through our new brand identities as AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors, we will begin to tell a simpler and more unified story of service. We will use a new logo that builds on our proud legacy but points to the future with a simpler and more modern look. And we will be launching a public awareness campaign to engage more Americans in meeting current and future challenges through service. These steps won\u2019t change our mission, programs, or how we operate, but they will provide important benefits now and in the future. When AmeriCorps is much better known, our members and volunteers will feel more connected to a national movement, our grantees will be better able to build local support, more organizations will want to participate, and more people will want to serve. Over time, these efforts will elevate awareness of opportunities to serve and ultimately, make service a cornerstone of our national culture. For years, we\u2019ve been dreaming of a better way to tell the story of national service. Today, we will start to make that dream come true. Thank you for being our partner in strengthening and uniting America through service.
