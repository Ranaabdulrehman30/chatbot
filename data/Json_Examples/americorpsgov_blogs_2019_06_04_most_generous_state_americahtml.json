More Americans than ever before are volunteering. The latest statistics released by the Corporation for National and Community Service show the U.S. is riding a wave of generosity driven by millions of people who freely offer their time, labor, and expertise. Overall, 77.4 million Americans volunteered 6.9 billion hours in 2017, the most recent figures available. That's worth an estimated value of nearly $167 billion, according to independent figures. The survey -- taken by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and released in November 2018 -- shows that 30.3%, or nearly one-third of adult Americans volunteer at least once a year. That's a hefty increase of more than 6 percentage points over the previous year .
