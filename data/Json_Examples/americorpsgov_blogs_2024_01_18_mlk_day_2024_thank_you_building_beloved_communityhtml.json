In 1994, Congress tasked AmeriCorps with leading Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, the only federal holiday designated as a National Day of Service, to encourage all Americans to volunteer to honor the life and legacy of Dr. King and improve their communities. Today, Americans and the world face compounding heartbreaking tragedy, highlighting inequities and injustices everywhere. Despite changing times, the importance of service remains unchanged \u2013 to overcome the forces that try to divide us, to see each other\u2019s humanity, and give our neighbors a helping hand. For three decades, @AmeriCorps has been honored to lead the #MLKDayOfService and unite Americans to build the #BelovedCommunity . As you serve to make Dr. King's dream a reality, grab your #MondayMotivation from @TheKingCenter 's CEO, @BerniceKing . #MLKDay #AmeriCorps30 pic.twitter.com/GD6w0Ttvjw \u2014 AmeriCorps (@AmeriCorps) January 15, 2024 This MLK Day 2024, thousands of Americans nationwide united to build the Beloved Community of Dr. King\u2019s dreams. Volunteers distributed fresh food, revamped their local schools, assembled care packages, and so much more to strengthen their communities. Each year, MLK Day Champions , organizations, and nonprofits from across the country join AmeriCorps and the King Center to honor Dr. King\u2019s legacy and create lasting change for our communities. Check out some of the MLK Day service projects from across the nation: Zeta Phi Beta Sorority , Incorporated As an organization steeped in service and an AmeriCorps MLK Day Champion, the sisters of Zeta Phi Beta, Inc. showed up and showed out. From coast to coast, chapters of their sorority united to feed veterans, provide resources to expecting parents, host MLK Day marches and celebrations, and more. Listen to Zeta Phi Beta President and CEO Dr. Stace NC Grant on the AmeriCorps podcast, Unheard Voices of Service, discuss whether Dr. King's dream still carries weight today and how service can take us from charity to justice. City of Orlando As an MLK Champion, the City of Orlando united its residents to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King through service. Together they kicked off MLK Day with U.S. Hunger to pack one million meals to assist those struggling with food security. In the suburbs, 130 volunteers and their GreenUp initiative came together for a beautification project, planting 50 trees, mulching, and cleaning up litter. Residents of Orlando united through service to pack meals. Civic Works in the Snow It may have been cold and snowing but that didn\u2019t stop volunteers serving with Civic Works .

In the last 30 years, we\u2019ve seen how service transforms communities and lives \u2013 from young people channeling their passions into purpose and careers to older folks passing down wisdom while building meaning and fulfillment in their own lives. AmeriCorps members turn one year of service into a lifetime of giving back. During our 30th anniversary , we celebrate and usher in the next era of service to see how it will continue to evolve to meet our country\u2019s ever-changing needs and deliver on the promise of Dr. King\u2019s example. As the year continues, we encourage you to keep the momentum going. Find volunteer opportunities , help others, and honor Dr. King\u2019s legacy throughout the rest of the year.
