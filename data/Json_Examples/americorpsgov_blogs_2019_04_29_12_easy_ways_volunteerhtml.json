The Corporation for National and Community Service encourages all Americans to see this celebration of service as an invitation to connect with their community and lend a helping hand. If you are interested in volunteering but aren\u2019t sure where to start, now is the perfect time to learn a bit more and join the fun. National Volunteer Week is a reminder of the power and passion of volunteers, and all the ways they make a difference. Senior Corps volunteers and AmeriCorps members are a prime example of this; they volunteer their time and come together to meet and exceed community goals. And when you volunteer, you do more than serve your community, you open yourself up to health benefits like increased energy, improved mood, and decreased social isolation. Volunteers are the lifeblood of many organizations, faith-based groups, community projects, and nonprofits, so we urge everyone with a heart for service to get involved now \u2013 and keep coming back.
