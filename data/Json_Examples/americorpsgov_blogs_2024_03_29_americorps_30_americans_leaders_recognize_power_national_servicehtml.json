Across the nation, AmeriCorps celebrated our milestones and efforts, as well as our members, volunteers, and alumni, throughout the month. Celebrating AmeriCorps 30 in Austin, Texas During the first week of March, AmeriCorps joined hundreds of educators and leaders at SXSW EDU . AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith hosted a panel discussion with City Year , Communities in Schools , and Teach for America to discuss how national service has been supporting our nation\u2019s education needs for the past 30 years. Through tutoring, mentoring, and providing wraparound supports, AmeriCorps has continuously provided the people-power to support teachers in classrooms, help programs innovate, expand opportunities, and advance innovative strategies to better support student success. AmeriCorps CEO also joined the Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten and Communities in Schools CEO and President Rey Salda\u00f1a at a local elementary school to hear about the impact of Americans who answered President Biden\u2019s call for 250,000 additional people to serve in evidence-based, student support roles. AmeriCorps members in Austin have been supporting the National Partnership for Student Success \u2019s efforts to accelerate student learning after the COVID-19 pandemic caused extensive disruption in our nation\u2019s schools. President Biden also announced plans to further support tutors and mentors, highlighting the importance of initiatives like NPSS during his State of the Union address. He stated, \u201cTo remain the strongest economy in the world we need the best education system in the world... I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning time and see to it that every child learns to read by third grade.\u201d Image Caption From left to right: City Year CEO Jim Balfanz, Communities in Schools National President and CEO Rey Salda\u00f1a, Teach for America CEO Elisa Villanueva Beard, and AmeriCorps CEO Michael D.
