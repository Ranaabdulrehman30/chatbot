Put your values into action and serve. Submitted by eschneider on Wed, 06/02/2021 - 17:36 Jun 02, 2021 AmeriCorps Staff What\u2019s at\u00a0my\u00a0core?\u00a0What drives\u00a0me? What matters? Those are\u00a0questions\u00a0so many Americans asked themselves this past year. What really matters\u00a0when the whole world is turned upside down\u00a0is what\u2019s at your core. For Americans, we are at our best when we\u00a0come\u00a0together for a common cause. While unprecedented in many ways, the coronavirus pandemic is no exception\u2014Americans from coast to coast\u00a0are doing what we always do\u2014finding a path forward, together. At\u00a0its\u00a0core, AmeriCorps , the federal agency for national service and community\u00a0volunteerism\u00a0brings\u00a0Americans\u2014young, old, from every state\u00a0and territory\u2014together to serve their communities. To tackle tough problems with sustainable, creative solutions. And we do it because it\u2019s who we are.\u00a0Over the last year, AmeriCorps members have\u00a0provided vital support, community response, and recovery efforts in response to the pandemic. Members\u00a0supported\u00a0more than 11 million Americans, including 2.3 million people at vaccination sites\u00a0and\u00a0extra support to\u00a0increase the capacity of state, local, and FEMA supported centers. And\u00a0we aren\u2019t\u00a0just helping folks get vaccinated. AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers Bill and Barb are helping feed neighbors in need by delivering meals. AmeriCorps member Alexis gives back by helping neighbors impacted by COVID-19 find a way to make ends\u00a0meet. And\u00a0Mushfequr,\u00a0an\u00a0AmeriCorps member\u00a0who is\u00a0driving\u00a0change by guiding students through\u00a0their\u00a0college applications. Each of these AmeriCorps members and volunteers\u00a0put their values\u2014determination,\u00a0compassion, hope\u2014to work to help friends, family, neighbors, and complete strangers\u00a0in\u00a0their communities, mentoring students, fighting climate change, combating hunger, serving homebound neighbors, and so much more. Your community needs you, too.\u00a0If you are waiting for someone to ask, we\u2019re asking.\u00a0Please\u00a0find an\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0opportunity\u00a0your community to help\u00a0us\u00a0move forward together. Like\u00a0our campaign stars, you can use your\u00a0passion to serve others\u00a0and\u00a0make\u00a0real, meaningful change in\u00a0your\u00a0neighborhood.\u00a0Right\u00a0now,\u00a0hundreds\u00a0of thousands of\u00a0members and volunteers serve with AmeriCorps to address some of our country\u2019s toughest challenges.
