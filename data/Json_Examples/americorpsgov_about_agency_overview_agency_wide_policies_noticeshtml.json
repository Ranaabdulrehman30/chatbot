AmeriCorps does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of these outside links. The inclusion of these links is not intended to reflect their importance, nor is it intended to endorse any views expressed, products, or services offered on these outside sites, or the organizations sponsoring them. Link Policy Toggle AmeriCorps links to websites that provide useful, timely, citizen-centered government information and services, consistent with our linking policy. Links to Government Websites AmeriCorps links to publicly available websites that are government-owned or government sponsored, unless directed not to by the agency that owns the site. Acceptable federal government-owned or government-sponsored website domains include .gov, .mil, and .fed.us. AmeriCorps also links to: quasi-government agencies and websites created by public sector/private sector partnerships; state and local government sites (e.g., www.maryland.gov ); and some government-sponsored websites that end in .com, .org, or .net (e.g., www.usps.com for the U.S. Postal Service and www.ncfy.com/clear.html for the National Clearinghouses on Homeless Youth & Families). Links to Non-Government Websites AmeriCorps websites also link to websites that are not government-owned or government-sponsored if these websites provide government information and/or services in a way that is not available on an official government website. AmeriCorps provides these non-government websites as a public service only. The U.S. government, including AmeriCorps, neither endorses nor guarantees in any way the external organizations, services, advice, or products included in these website links. Furthermore, the U.S. government neither controls nor guarantees the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of the information contained in non-government website links. Evaluation Criteria AmeriCorps staff evaluates all links using the following criteria: Is the website an official government-owned or supported website? If not, does the website provide government information and/or services in a way that is not available on an official government website? Does the website complement existing information, products, and services from AmeriCorps? Is the website accessible and applicable to a wide audience? Is the website\u2019s content relevant, useful, and authoritative for citizens, businesses, and/or government officials? Does the website\u2019s information appear to be accurate and current? Is the website\u2019s approach to the privacy of personal information consistent with the government's privacy and security policies? Is the primary intent of the website to educate and inform, rather than persuade, convert, or sell? The site may include advertising but must be free from heavy marketing or promotion of products. Does the website provide information free of charge? Reciprocal Links Though any site is welcome to link to AmeriCorps websites, we do not engage in reciprocal linking. Our sites are in the public domain, and there is no cost or special permission required to link to them. Featured Links AmeriCorps websites feature links, information, and services based on one or more of the following highly desirable criteria: The website enables citizens, businesses, and/or government officials to conduct transactions online (e.g., buy materials for national service needs or projects). The website provides citizens, businesses, and/or government officials with the information they need to interact directly with government organizations (e.g., clearly available telephone numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses, and instructions). The website provides citizens with information about service performance. The website provides community-level information and services (e.g., MapStats, post office locators, Social Security Office locators, National Park Service Guides, and veterans\u2019 facilities). Prohibitions AmeriCorps will not link to any website that exhibits hate, bias, discrimination, specific religious views, or social agendas. Furthermore, AmeriCorps reserves the right to deny or remove any link that contains misleading information or unsubstantiated claims or is determined to be in conflict with AmeriCorps\u2019 mission or policies. Disclaimer of Endorsement The information posted on AmeriCorps websites includes hypertext links or pointers to information created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations. AmeriCorps provides these links and pointers solely for our users\u2019 information and convenience. AmeriCorps does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on a linked website. AmeriCorps does not endorse the organizations sponsoring linked websites and does not endorse the views expressed or products offered therein. AmeriCorps cannot authorize the use of copyrighted, trademarked, and servicemarked\u00a0materials contained in linked websites.
