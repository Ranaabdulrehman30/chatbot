Despite divides, differences, and ideologies, we came together as a nation. We grieved as a community, cared for one another, and then set to work rebuilding and lifting our neighborhoods. The heroism of trained volunteers and first responders inspired thousands of then-teenagers and 20-somethings to act. Many enlisted in the military during wartime and knowingly risked their lives to protect our country. Others chose to serve their country through volunteer or national service opportunities with AmeriCorps, aiding the injured, serving as family caseworkers, and helping those displaced from Ground Zero find housing and other services. Julie, an AmeriCorps member with the NCCC program serving with a community of schools in Aurora, Ill., was flown to support recovery efforts after the 9/11 attacks. First in Washington, D.C. for three days, Julie and her team supported a Red Cross call center open to anyone with friends, family and loved ones in impacted areas. She talked with individuals in an effort to reconnect family and friends. \"Because of 9/11, I dedicated my life to service. Now I understand the importance of getting programs and policies in place to help volunteers get in there and get things done.\u201d -Julie, AmeriCorps Alumna Julie and her team were next flown to New York City, where she spent two months as a case manager at Pier 94\u2014helping people who had lost loved ones, lost homes, lost jobs. After completing her NCCC service, Julie returned to New York City to volunteer again, this time with one of 10 Red Cross centers \u2013 supporting the general recovery effort and managing cases. 9/11 changed her life.
