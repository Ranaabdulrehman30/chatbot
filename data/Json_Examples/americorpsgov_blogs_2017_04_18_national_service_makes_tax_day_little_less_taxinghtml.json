However, there is some good news for a lot of Americans, thanks to our AmeriCorps and Senior Corps programs. CNCS supports low- and middle-income families in many ways, one of which is by offering free tax preparation services through many of our programs. In 2016, AmeriCorps members and Senior Corps volunteers helped 280,000 families and individuals file their taxes and recover millions in tax refunds and tax credits. But wait, there\u2019s more to the story. Since 2010, more than 460 AmeriCorps NCCC members have provided tax assistance to residents across 14 states. When you add up the benefits provided through this service, our AmeriCorps NCCC members have helped to return $100 million to American taxpayers . Currently six AmeriCorps NCCC teams are support tax projects in California, Missouri, Montana, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Thanks to all the AmeriCorps members and Senior Corps volunteers who are making tax day a little less taxing.
