We are committed to full compliance with these laws and ensuring our grantees have the necessary training and tools. Recruiting and Retaining a Diverse Corps: We must increase representation in our national service corps from the communities we serve. We plan to do this by providing greater access to national service opportunities and benefits for people from underserved communities. Partnering with Native Communities: Our responsibilities to American Indians and Alaskan Natives and our nation-to-nation relationship with Tribal governments is driven by our Committee on Native American Affairs, which has supported our prioritized actions in this area to address longstanding barriers. Addressing Limited English Proficiency and Ensuring Language Access: Advancing equity through our resources and opportunities is impossible if they are not accessible. We must ensure that anyone, despite their level of English proficiency, can access our resources and service opportunities. Increasing Equity in Our Procurement Process: Much of how we accomplish our mission has to do with the vendors and contractors we utilize. Their services, experience, and diverse backgrounds are critical to advancing equity at AmeriCorps.

Increased the living allowance for AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps VISTA Resources Toggle AmeriCorps Strategic Plan Learn more about the Administration\u2019s Equity Agenda Advancing Equity Through the American Rescue Plan Learn more about government-wide equity efforts Stakeholder Engagement Toggle AmeriCorps engaged with stakeholders to conduct a DEIA assessment of three key areas of operations: fostering an equitable workplace; promoting equitable grantmaking; and recruiting and retaining a diverse corps of AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers. Stakeholder input strongly influenced the recommendations from the employee-driven DEIA initiative, the agency\u2019s Equity Action Plan, and the FY 2021-FY 2025 AmeriCorps Strategic Plan development. AmeriCorps implemented a variety of stakeholder engagement strategies: Workforce-Driven DEIA Assessment and Workforce Survey \u2013 The 2020 DEIA initiative was driven by more than 50 passionate volunteers from across the AmeriCorps workforce who spent months evaluating agency operations, assessing barriers to advancing DEIA, and supporting underserved communities. Stakeholder Engagement Panels \u2013 AmeriCorps hosted three stakeholder engagement panels which included representatives from four association partners: Americas Service Commission, Voices for National Service, Service Year Alliance, and AmeriCorps Seniors Association. Panelists also included grantees from AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors programs: VISTA, AmeriCorps State and National, and AmeriCorps NCCC. Representation from the Office of Regional Operations included current and former staff members. AmeriCorps asked panelists the following questions: Within your own program (AmeriCorps VISTA, State & National, NCCC) what are barriers for you in applying, partnering, grant management, or other requirements that make it difficult to partner with us? What are specific immediate and longer-term changes we should consider to make our programming more accessible? What would you identify as the top three barriers to starting service for applicants from diverse backgrounds? What would you identify as the top three barriers to continuing/completing service for members from diverse backgrounds? What assistance would be beneficial for AmeriCorps to offer throughout the process (from proposal writing through grant management) to make our funding more accessible (planning grants, increased technical assistance, etc.)? What should stronger outreach and recruitment to new applicants look like? Do you have recommendations for us as an agency on ways to reach out and recruit more potential applicants working in Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) communities? What are specific funding priorities or performance measures would allow you to focus your work more on diverse communities (BIPOC, LGBTQ, etc.)? Tribal Consultation \u2013 In April 2021, AmeriCorps hosted a Tribal consultation with Tribal leaders to ensure that AmeriCorps is equitable, fair, and accessible to Tribal nations. This allowed the agency to learn more about what is working, what is not working, and to make sure opportunities and resources meet the needs of Tribal nations. Participants were asked to share feedback on the following: Barriers for Tribal communities to access AmeriCorps resources, for members to serve with AmeriCorps and to achieve compliance with grants requirements. Ways AmeriCorps can support COVID response and recovery. Ways AmeriCorps can support veterans and military families. How AmeriCorps can more effectively consult and strengthen communications and relationships. Best practices from other agencies AmeriCorps should review. Ways to use technology to solicit tribal feedback on policies and activities. Ways to disseminate information that is most relevant. Request for Information \u2013 As part of AmeriCorps\u2019 ARP investment , the agency pledged to create new national service opportunities; increase benefits for service members; and support nonprofit, Tribal, and community organizations that support underserved communities. To do this, AmeriCorps looked further into the barriers programs and members face. In accordance with Executive Order 13985 and as part of the agency\u2019s commitment to DEIA, AmeriCorps launched a Request for Information (RFI), which closed on August 2, 2021, inviting public comment from any interested party, including current and former AmeriCorps program award recipients. Respondents relayed comments regarding any barriers that they, or the communities they served, faced in accessing benefits and services offered by AmeriCorps\u2019 programs. This request gave the agency insight from members, volunteers, the broader national service community, and outside voices. AmeriCorps received over 600 comments, significant for a small agency, with the overwhelming majority focused on the value of the AmeriCorps living allowance and end of service Eli Segal Education award benefit. The comments were further analyzed by the Office of Research and Evaluation and supported a compelling case for increasing the living allowance and expanding flexibilities for the use of the Eli Segal Education End-of-Service Award . AmeriCorps looks forward to continuing to engage with national service stakeholders and the public. We will be announcing opportunities to share input on the plan in the coming months.
