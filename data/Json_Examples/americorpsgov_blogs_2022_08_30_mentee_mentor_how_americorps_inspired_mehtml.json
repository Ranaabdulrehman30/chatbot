Kevin during his service with College Possible I am a first-generation college student. When I first started applying for colleges, navigating the process was stressful and scary. There were so many components beyond an essay. I\u2019ve never done it and since my parents didn\u2019t go to college, they weren\u2019t sure what to do or how to help me with things like filling out FAFSA. I had no one to ask for help. Then I came across College Possible at the start of my junior year at Lake View High School (Ill.). It was a program that provides mentors and peers who could help high school students with the college application process, step-by-step. College Possible was what I needed. In the end, the program is what helped me attend and graduate from DePauw University (Ind.). College Possible is also what motivated me to serve during college. I participated in the Bonner Scholars program, a competitive scholarship for students committed to volunteering in their communities. As a Bonner Scholar, I was able to leverage my background in computer science and volunteering to teach robotics to students at a local community center. Helping my community and the students thrive was a fulfilling experience. It helped me realize that teaching students, especially those with limited access to resources, was something I am passionate about. So, after graduation, I decided to continue my service. I went back home to join the place that kickstarted my passion for service - College Possible. This time, I was a College Possible coach through AmeriCorps. Kevin with a few of his students Since I was once a College Possible student, I knew what kids like me needed the most. I hoped to make a difference for other first-generation students, helping guide them through the overwhelming college process. However, I was surprised to see how many new challenges students were facing due to the pandemic. Many worked long hours, balancing jobs with academics and extracurriculars. One high school junior worked at her after-school job until close to midnight, leaving her little time for homework, let alone college planning. To help students like her, I had to figure out how to navigate these challenges and address their needs.\u00a0 I remember how my own coach, Taylor, would offer reassurance, help me voice my concerns, and make a plan for completing tasks when I was feeling especially stressed. As a coach, I want to offer the same support, taking time to build relationships with my students through individual conversations in addition to the twice-weekly sessions I lead after school. I meet with them one-on-one to create priority lists and talk through the problems they are facing. I also look for opportunities to provide students with resources they may not be able to get from anyone else, including friends or family. I met one student in her junior year, a professional youth swimmer who plans to pursue both swimming and STEM in college. Despite her demanding extracurricular schedule, she never missed any of our after-school workshops and frequently came to our one-on-ones during the school day to talk through college lists and scholarship applications. College Possible also nominated her for the Posse Scholarship this year, and we worked together to prepare and submit her application. We still check in monthly while she is preparing for her first round of interviews for the scholarship. Like I did with this student, I try my best to find and open as many doors as possible for my mentees because we all deserve this, no matter our backgrounds. My AmeriCorps experience strengthened my drive for service and education. It is why I will pursue a career in these fields in the future.
