The RSVP projects announced today will leverage the experience and skills of more than 7,700 Seniors Corps RSVP volunteers who will serve in schools, veteran\u2019s organizations, and disaster service initiatives. Grantees will address a variety of local issues and provide support services for disaster response, early childhood education, veterans and military families, homebound adults and caregivers, substance abuse prevention, and more. A complete list of grants is available here .

Through community and faith-based organizations, RSVP volunteers served more than 300,000 veterans, mentored more than 78,000 children, and provided independent living services to more than 797,000 older adults.
