The WINGS program was implemented at four low-performing schools in Charleston County, South Carolina, where groups of 12 boys or girls worked with a WINGS leader who served as a mentor and teacher. The evaluation included an implementation and impact study. The impact study was a randomized control trial where children entering kindergarten were assigned to the program (in a group of boys or girls) or a control group. The evaluation incorporated data from parents, teachers, WINGS staff, individual child testing and observational data. The study examined if WINGS had a positive impact after the first and second year of participation on children\u2019s person-centered competencies, relationships and behaviors in the classroom and at home, short-term academic skills, and whether impacts vary depending on children\u2019s characteristics or level of initial skills. The results of one year of participation show no significant effects, which is consistent with WINGS\u2019 theory that two years of participation is needed. In building block measures, children who attended WINGS for two years showed significant gains in naming vocabulary (effect size = .26, p<0.05) and executive function (Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders, effect size = .26, p<0.10). They also showed promising gains in positive classroom behavior and reducing negative classroom behaviors, although these do not reach the p<0.05 significance level.
