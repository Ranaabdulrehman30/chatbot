Earlier this week, AmeriCorps CEO Barbara Stewart held a video conference with veteran AmeriCorps members to learn about their service with Washington Vet Corps and the Mt. Adams Institute in Washington.\u202fWhether continuing their service to our country on college campuses or public lands, the veterans serving in AmeriCorps have adapted to the changes caused by COVID-19. After serving in the military, many veterans wish to pursue a degree but need guidance navigating the resources and programs meant to help them achieve their higher education goals. The Washington Vet Corps enlists AmeriCorps members to serve as peer mentors and counselors to veterans in colleges and universities across Washington state. These AmeriCorps members provide training to help institutions meet the needs of their veteran students and directly support veterans new to higher education through peer connections and direction to available benefits. Eric Burns, a former combat medic in the US Army and current AmeriCorps member, originally joined the Vet Corps program while pursuing his master\u2019s degree and deemed it \u201cone of the most rewarding experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eric noted that it has been challenging to connect with the community while virtual, but he\u2019s worked to remedy this barrier with events such as a virtual Veteran\u2019s Day celebration for veterans and their families. Another AmeriCorps member, former Army Combat Engineer Trent Mortensen, shifted his focus to rural outreach after the pandemic hit. Through the transition from in person to a virtual space, Mortensen noted that he\u2019s reaching people who wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had access. Reflecting on his own experience after leaving the military, Mortensen notes that being \u201cable to push [veterans] to resources that I never had\u201d has been a \u201cbig motivation factor.\u201d The Mt. Adams Institute, another AmeriCorps program in Washington, provides veterans with apprenticeship opportunities focused on improving public lands and managing their natural resources. There are multiple programs for veterans to choose from, ranging from natural resource management to wildland firefighting. Veterans often acquire unique skills during their service, and Mt. Adams Institute provides the opportunity to use and expand upon those abilities. Most alluring for some is the chance to continue service to the public. Jon Knepper, Marine Corps veteran, explained that he \u201cstruggled with finding a sense of fulfillment\u201d upon discharge. The Mt. Adams Institute allowed him to do work that made an impact on the world around him., As part of his service, Knepper worked on a community garden to provide the surrounding area with access to fresh food. In the face of Covid-19, he hopes that it can help anyone struggling with food insecurity as well as reduce the need for trips to markets in more populated areas. For many veterans, AmeriCorps programs have served as both a launchpad to future goals and as a tangible career path. With the guidance of his program supervisor, former Navy intelligence analyst Hunter Haley applied and was accepted to Portland State University\u2019s Environmental Science Program. Both Trent Mortensen and Eric Burns hope to continue their service in AmeriCorps as regional coordinators. Channette Purser-Smith, current North Seattle College student, credits Washington Vet Corps with helping her stay in school, going on to state that \u201cbeing in the program really helped me succeed.\u201d For veterans looking to continue their service, AmeriCorps programs not only offer the chance to complete meaningful work, while gaining valuable resources and experiences for the future.
