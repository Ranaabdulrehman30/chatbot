When disaster strikes, AmeriCorps responds. From hurricanes and wildfires to windstorms and floods, communities impacted by disasters can count on AmeriCorps to be there long after the cameras are gone. Currently, national service members are actively responding to disaster response in at least six state and supporting long-term recovery efforts in many more. Iowa Derecho : On August 10, a devastating windstorm struck western Iowa causing significant damage throughout the area. With leadership from Volunteer Iowa, national service programs throughout the region \u2013 and beyond \u2013 quickly responded. More than 75 AmeriCorps members, including AmeriCorps Disaster Response teams, have helped Iowans clean up debris, serve warm meals, distribute emergency supplies, and coordinate volunteers. Hurricane Laura : When Hurricane Laura struck the coast of Louisiana and Texas, national service programs from across the country responded. More than 200 AmeriCorps members have actively participated in response and recovery efforts, with more joining in the weeks ahead. Those members, which include AmeriCorps NCCC, FEMA Corps, and local AmeriCorps programs, are involved in debris removal, blue tarp roof installation, Red Cross mass care activities, FEMA planning and logistics support, and disaster survivor assistance efforts. \u200b West Coast Wildfires : For several months, wildfires have destroyed millions of acres of land and thousands of homes throughout California, Oregon and Washington. While many fires are still raging, more than 275 national service members are actively responding throughout the west coast. In California, AmeriCorps members with the California Conservation Corps, FEMA Corps, and AmeriCorps NCCC are supporting firefighter base camp operations, engaging in firefighting and fuel reduction activities, and supporting disaster survivor assistance efforts. In Oregon, AmeriCorps NCCC teams have deployed to support the ongoing wildfire response and recovery. AmeriCorps provides strong support, expertise, and trained and dedicated volunteers to help communities to prepare for, mitigate, respond, and recover from natural and man-made disasters.
