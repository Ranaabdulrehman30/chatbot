His words still resonate today as a powerful symbol of his unwavering dedication to a fair and just society , urging all Americans to unite in pursuit of a shared vision of freedom and justice. Six decades later, we continue to honor and be inspired by Dr. King's legacy on MLK Day and every day , like our AmeriCorps Seniors volunteer Florence. AmeriCorps Seniors volunteer Florence Learning Peace from Dr. King AmeriCorps Seniors volunteer Florence marched alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., during the civil rights movement. Florence was living in Phoenix, Ariz., with her airman husband. Like her experience growing up in Illinois, Florence faced discrimination in Phoenix, which motivated her to join the movement. More than 50 years later, Florence continues to remember and honor Dr. King by serving her community as a F oster G randparent in Illinois. \u201cMartin had a powerful voice. He was a short, dark-skinned Black man, but he had a voice that would project anywhere. When I first met Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I was ready to fight. But the first thing he said when we got there to march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. , was, \u2018If you want to fight, go home because we\u2019re not fighting. This is going to be a peaceful demonstration.\u2019 And he talked us into being peaceful, which I carry with me today. Grandma Flo (far left) during the march \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand how it is when you\u2019re in a situation like that. I was discriminated against, but never to that extent in Alabama. That was a horrible feeling to be discriminated against with dogs turned on you to bite you and police there with guns saying, \u2018You can\u2019t do this, you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 I never had that much power against me. We marched for as long as we could and spent nights out in the area, encountering planes flying overhead and bombs. There were a lot of times we were ready to give up, but Martin kept us going until that fateful day at the motel. \u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to stay at that motel in Memphis, Tennessee . We went down to help bring the sanitation workers union into effect. We were scheduled to stay at the hotel, but when we got there, they said we couldn\u2019t stay. We had to stay at the motel. They told Martin not to go out on the balcony, but he had to speak to his constituents. He had been out there about five minutes when he was shot. I was in another room at the motel and came running to see if we could do anything, but there wasn\u2019t . Everybody wanted to fight at that moment , but we couldn\u2019t . We needed to go by Martin\u2019s wishes \u2013 be peaceful.\u201d Committing to a Life of Service Grandma Flo has since dedicated her time to service. She joined ABC AmeriCorps at Sauk Valley Community College, serving in local schools, and then she continued to work in her community. S he faced challenges again but found solace through service. They\u2019re talkative in second grade, but they\u2019re great to work with and willing to learn , and that\u2019s the best part about it. Grandma Flo at her service site in Illinois \u201cMy husband left me; I was alone, just sitting at home, thinking of something I needed to do. I saw an opportunity to serve again as an older adult at ABC AmeriCorps, so I joined again to serve my community. Joining AmeriCorps Seniors is the best thing I have ever done because working with children gives me the incentive to keep going . The incentive to get up in the morning, come to school, and work with them. It\u2019s very rewarding , and you can learn from children. Children can teach you some things that maybe you\u2019ve forgotten. \u201cI don\u2019t tell my students or others that I marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., unless someone asks because people don\u2019t remember. But MLK Day of Service means everything. They celebrate the day, and it\u2019s a national holiday, but many people have forgotten Martin Luther King , Jr . The Day of Service is an opportunity to honor him. More people should know what it was all about and how it affected everybody\u2019s lives. They should never forget that.\u201d Commit to Building the Beloved Community Like Grandma Flo, many AmeriCorps members, AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers, and alums have found their purpose through remembering Dr. King. Whether it\u2019s to relive the memory of marching alongside Dr. King or honor his legacy, AmeriCorps has been committed to joining together in service to unify Americans of different backgrounds and experiences to transform unjust systems . Commit to serve and create ripples that make a world of difference. Join the thousands of Americans from all walks of life who will participate in service projects to honor Dr. King\u2019s legacy. Through service , together, we are one step closer to the Beloved Community of Dr. King\u2019s dream.
