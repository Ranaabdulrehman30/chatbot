Ruby Bridges\u2019 walk to school became a symbol of the Civil Rights struggle In 1960, 6-year-old Ruby Bridges\u2019 daily walk to class took her past an angry mob and into Civil Rights history when she became the first African American child to attend an all-white elementary school in the South. Though she only lived five blocks from her new school, Ruby previously attended an all-black segregated school several miles away. After the Louisiana State Legislature exhausted all its options in a long battle against a federal court order to integrate the schools, Ruby was allowed to attend the classes near her home. \u201cI understood it was important but it didn\u2019t hit me until I saw that Norman Rockwell painting. And I realize that it wasn\u2019t something that just happened in New Orleans but it was something that people all across the country, all around the world actually, recognized, especially through the painting.\u201c -Ruby Bridges Each day, Ruby was escorted to the William Frantz School by federal marshals who ensured her safe arrival. Her first year at the school was tumultuous to say the least, and many white parents refused to allow their children to attend classes as long as Ruby was there. She also had to continue to navigate the mob every day, and endure threats to herself and her family. But Ruby\u2019s trials were eased by the kindness of Barbara Henry, the only white teacher who agreed to work with her at William Frantz. An interview with a reporter when Bridges was 17 or 18 brought home the significance of her walk past a throng of angry protesters. \u201cI understood it was important but it didn\u2019t hit me until I saw that Norman Rockwell painting. And I realize that it wasn\u2019t something that just happened in New Orleans but it was something that people all across the country, all around the world actually, recognized, especially through the painting. \u201cAnd I always say that the lesson I took away was a lesson that Dr. King tried to teach all of us \u2013 and that was we should never look at a person and judge them by the color of their skin.\u201d Ruby\u2019s story is a reminder that it only takes a few people to come together and create the change that can help heal our nation\u2019s deepest wounds.
