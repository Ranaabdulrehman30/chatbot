He discusses the difficult process with all the nuance and complexity of someone who has been down this path before. Community buy-in sure doesn\u2019t come easy, for example. But to drive home his point, McAteer is willing to table the intricacies and strip down \u201csustainability\u201d to its bluntest, barest form: \u201cYou don\u2019t just finish a project, take a digital photo, and move on.\u201d It\u2019s a refreshing insight from someone whose career has required him to move on a lot, from one mission to the next. McAteer is an accomplished Army veteran \u2013 a recently retired brigadier general with 29 years of service \u2013 and now a first-time AmeriCorps VISTA member expanding food sovereignty across Wyoming. In the military, his command and staff positions ran the gamut and the globe: assignments in Kuwait and Iraq, leading battalions in Afghanistan, disaster relief in Haiti, and overseeing strategy, plans, and policy for U.S. Africa Command. McAteer\u2019s new role as an AmeriCorps VISTA member at the University of Wyoming Cooperative Extension appears quite different at first glance. His supervisor, Lina Dunning, sums up his service as \u201cfinding ways to ensure that people living with poverty have access to fresh, local, healthy food in a way that still benefits local producers.\u201d McAteer has been mapping resources, conducting needs assessments, and even organizing a statewide conference in December in an effort to ensure his project has a lasting impact. Dunning is the Director of the Action Resources International VISTA Intermediary Program in Laramie, Wyoming. This is not the first time in her career that she has supervised an AmeriCorps VISTA member. \u201cBut no,\u201d she quickly adds, \u201cI\u2019ve never supervised a brigadier general.\u201d McAteer was inspired to join AmeriCorps VISTA after returning to the U.S. following his final Army post in Germany. Like many veterans who decide to join AmeriCorps as a second chapter of service, he appreciated that national service is an arena for people of like spirit to accomplish missions together with a sense of purpose. Though McAteer was drawn to his Wyoming project partly by the allure of the Rocky Mountains and the American frontier, he was also still reflecting on the extreme poverty and hunger he saw in West Africa during his time as Deputy Director of Strategy, Plans, and Policy at U.S. Africa Command. \u201cIt was really an eye-opening experience,\u201d explains McAteer. \u201cGetting to see the conditions there from a policy standpoint. You have massive amounts of people living hand-to-mouth, fighting hunger. I saw all that and thought about governance and development issues, on a human level as well.\u201d It\u2019s no coincidence, then, that his AmeriCorps VISTA position is one that addresses food security on both a statewide and an individual level. As different as a year of AmeriCorps VISTA may initially seem when compared to a full career in the Army, McAteer can\u2019t help but draw surprising parallels between his military service and his national service. The main constant through every project is the goal of sustainability. After a tragic earthquake leveled Haiti in 2010, McAteer assisted the nation\u2019s recovery process as an Army Brigade Commander. As McAteer explains, the Army played a critical role in a large, interagency process. He had the forces, the manpower, and the sense of urgency necessary to help Haitians rebuild, but he soon realized the key to long-term sustainability was effective coordination of resources. With so many organizations and agencies deployed to assist, McAteer needed to break down barriers among them and make sure everyone was working from the same page, towards the same end. Back in Wyoming, McAteer explains that he sees many of the same dynamics at play in his collaborations with the state\u2019s food producers, retailers, policymakers, and agencies. His task is to build bridges between these actors and help them connect the dots in order to improve statewide food security in a way that is beneficial to everyone. The real difference, McAteer acknowledges, is that change outside the military comes at a naturally slower pace. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they lack urgency,\u201d McAteer clarifies. \u201cThey just sometimes lack resources.\u201d Dunning explains the challenge further: \u201cAs [Tim] has been able to meet with people, he\u2019s seen how passionate they are. But most of the people he talks to are volunteers or business owners, and many of them just don\u2019t have the time as a volunteer to, say, spearhead a statewide coalition or local food movement. Their plates are full trying to make a living, trying to keep their heads above water.\u201d That\u2019s where the role of an AmeriCorps VISTA member comes in. \u201cThat motivates me,\u201d says McAteer. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to put in the extra time to move forward these social causes. [To them] this is a side job, a passion project. I needed to learn to be more patient and empathetic to their views and perspectives.\u201d He\u2019s also keenly aware of how fragile sustainable development can be and what steps he must take in Wyoming to ensure that his project remains successful long after his AmeriCorps VISTA service is over. During a second stint in Afghanistan, McAteer was south of Kabul along the infamous two-lane highway called the Ring Road. He was visiting the city of Ghanzi where his battalion had begun building some infrastructure during his previous deployment the year before. The results he saw as he looked around town were mixed. \u201cYou returned and ran into people you knew, and a lot was gone. Some of the things you really thought were sustainable, weren\u2019t.\u201d But then he heard some laughter from a nearby schoolyard and recognized it as a girls\u2019 school that he had started building his first time around. The sound of a healthy education. \u201cYou get a generation, 10 - 15 years, to get an education. That is the sustainable capacity that could last.\u201d In only a few short months, Tim McAteer\u2019s one-year term in AmeriCorps VISTA will come to a close. It\u2019s a difficult reality, but he\u2019s come to accept it. \u201cAs badly as I want to finish, I\u2019m going to have to pass the torch. But hopefully the foundation [we\u2019ve built] is in clay.\u201d Previous Heroes in Search of Their Next Mission Next Corporation for National and Community Service & AmeriCorps NCCC Donate Surplus N95 Masks to Louisiana Back to main content Sign up to hear about our latest news, events, and opportunities.
