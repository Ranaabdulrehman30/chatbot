Together, they cleaned brush and debris, planted trees and shrubs, and created a trail and garden beds. AmeriCorps members and volunteers beatify an vacant lot. Jayna, the Civic Works director of volunteerism and events joined the service project.

Elizabeth\u2019s mother, Esther, said the response to her daughter\u2019s death should be service. Pictured above on the shirt is a quote from Esther. \u201cWhat these people are doing is what we all should be doing in response to my daughter's death and the deaths of thousands on September 11. Please tell them for me, \u2018thank you\u2019.. I do not want revenge...I want peace.\" -Esther Heymann . @CivicWorksInc Director of Volunteerism and Events Jayna serves her community on #911Day .
