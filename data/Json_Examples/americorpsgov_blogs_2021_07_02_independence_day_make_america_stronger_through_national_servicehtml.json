As Americans celebrate the Fourth of July, it is a good time to consider what\u2019s at our core as a country, and how can we strengthen the spirt of service we hold dear. This vision of service for the greater good is core to who we are as a nation. When we serve, with honor and in unity, we bring out the best of America\u2014and find solutions to many of today\u2019s biggest challenges. Examples are all around us. Being called to disaster zones, AmeriCorps members bring order, safety, assistance, and a welcoming smile to communities in need. Members across the country raised their hand to join national service during a pandemic\u2014nearly 3.5 million hours served as part of COVID-19 relief efforts and more than 11 million people received assistance. Each day, AmeriCorps members in our VISTA programs work tirelessly to end poverty challenges, like hunger and education inequity. This is who we are. Veterans who proudly served our country in uniform, find their next mission in national service. They build and repair homes, mentor children, and support other veterans who need knowing support to best transition to civilian life. Loretta , a 10-year Army and Air Force veteran is doing just that. She serves veterans as an AmeriCorps member managing day-to-day operations at one of the nation\u2019s only veterans-focused food pantries located in a VA medical center in Chicago. \u201cIt is a great opportunity to be able to help meet the needs of my fellow veterans and take on the challenge of the AmeriCorps pledge to \u2018get things done for America,\u201d she said when talking about what drives her passion to serve. This is what we do. As a nation focused on helping others, uniting in a national service movement will make this country stronger \u2013 especially if we work together. Whether it\u2019s assisting a neighbor in need, helping a student with their class assignments, serving as a Senior Companion, or responding to community disasters, there is no shortage of ways to get involved. Every American has something to give. No matter your age, background, or where you come from, you can have an impact through service. So this Independence Day, as we celebrate 245 years as a nation: make America stronger and unite in service.
