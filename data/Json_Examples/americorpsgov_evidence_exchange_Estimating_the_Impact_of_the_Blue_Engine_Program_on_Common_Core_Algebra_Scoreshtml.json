It provides instructional support and tutoring, facilitates extra learning time for students, and implements a social cognitive curriculum. Study Goals : The goal of the report was to estimate the effect of the Blue Engine intervention on Common Core algebra test scores in 2013-2014. Research Questions : The research question was: How did students that participated in the Blue Engine program perform on the Common Core algebra exam compared to students who did not participate in the program? Findings: The report found the following: The average scores and pass rates were significantly higher among Blue Engine students than the comparison group. Blue Engine may be a promising intervention for helping students learn Common Core algebra content and prepare for more rigorous tests. By providing students with more individualized instruction and extra learning time, Blue Engine may be able to close the gap for students who enter high school at a deficit to their peers.
