At the start of the summer, we checked in with the grantees to get the latest scoop on their program planning and see what lessons they learned along the way. By now, most of the grantees\u2019 planning periods have come to a close. For some, program development will carry on through continued efforts, while others have compiled their findings, which provide valuable guidance for other organizations seeking similar types of grants. With that, we conducted a final follow up with the grantees to hear about their latest program development updates, overall experience with their grants, and what\u2019s next. Appalachian Regional\nCoalition on Homelessness Appalachian Regional\nCoalition on Homelessness (ARCH) continued working with the Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to plan a coordinated entry\nsystem \u2013 a streamlined platform for housing the most vulnerable homeless people\nfirst. Through the system, AmeriCorps members provide services to\nhomeless and economically disadvantaged populations in Northeast Tennessee.\nThat planning was made possible thanks to the CNCS grant, and ARCH has since\nconnected with the United Way to proceed with implementation. Toward the end of the planning grant, ARCH focused on seeking\na new grant opportunity to get its program off the ground for fiscal year\n2018-2019. The planning grant enabled ARCH to connect with all of the service\nproviders, eventually leading them to the United Way organizations, where the\nteam was able to educate them about the Housing First program model and how\nAmeriCorps members can be involved. With five members ready to begin the program back in August,\nARCH was working through some back-end challenges with the AmeriCorps portal.\nAn employee departure at the time left the ARCH team to navigate the portal\nthemselves until its new AmeriCorps Development Coordinator was hired, so it\nwas a slower process to onboard the AmeriCorps members. Still, ARCH was pleased with what the CNCS grant allowed\nthem to accomplish. It provided an opportunity to incorporate AmeriCorps\nmembers into the Department of Housing and Urban Development-mandated Housing\nFirst model while giving them time to learn as much as possible about the\nplanned program. ARCH recommends that all grantees explore the CNCS website and\nattend all training sessions, as they provide invaluable information. Most recently, Volunteer Tennessee, which began its program on Sept. 15, funded ARCH for FY18-19. Artesian Schools Using the Talent Search youth development program as a\nfoundation, Artesian Schools, Inc., (Artesian) finished its initial planning\ngrant to build a program\nthat leverages AmeriCorps programs as mentors to tutor disadvantaged high\nschool students in academics, career planning, and financial counseling. Toward the end of the grant, Artesian hired a new principal,\nwho reviewed data from separate Talent Search implementations to identify\npotential adjustments to how the tutoring is delivered and its curriculum.\nArtesian also partnered with an instructional consulting group that helped them\ndetermine the best use of tutoring time. The goal of the tutoring is not just\nto build missing skills, but also to \u201cscaffold up\u201d the knowledge students need\nto fully comprehend and apply what they\u2019re learning. At the same time, Artesian\nworked on the mentoring aspect of its program, which is separate from tutoring\nand ensures a cohesive experience. Although the team is using Talent Search as a foundation,\nArtesian is adapting the intervention and customizing its own program to\naddress the unique needs of its students. This is simultaneously an opportunity\nand challenge. Artesian has the chance to make something new and different \u2013 a\nprogram that could then be the model for the county, Tennessee, and the nation\nas a whole. At the same time, it requires significant buy-in and contribution\nfrom Artesian staff, which means maintaining enthusiasm and gathering feedback are\nsignificant priorities. Artesian was very appreciative of the opportunity to\nparticipate in this planning grant, especially the focus on the evaluation\naspect, as it wasn\u2019t something the team might have thought about as early in\nthe program development. Looking to the future, the team received another\nAmeriCorps grant back in August, which has allowed them to continue tweaking\nthe member experience this semester and plan for the following one. Association of\nClinicians for the Underserved Since the last update, Association\nof Clinicians for the Underserved (ACU) focused on further refining and\nstrengthening its proposed program, which trains AmeriCorps members as\npatient \u201cconnectors\u201d that provide patient-centered interventions such as case\nmanagement assistance with coverage enrollment. ACU held a web-based meeting\nwith its field partners to gather their feedback. It was an affirming moment,\nas the partners reported that the intent of the program, its interventions, and\nthe proposed community support hit all the right notes with their expectations.\nThat said, ACU continued to collect feedback from partners for further planning\nand potential improvements. ACU then turned its attention to confirming the details of\nthe model with its program officer and ORE, who they met with\nthroughout the entire grant process. One of ACU\u2019s priorities during the grant\nwas to make sure the team was confident in the program design, so they could\ntranslate it to a strong program on paper and submit it for official review.\nFocusing heavily on program design and model would also enable ACU to dive back\ninto work with little disruption once the notice of funding opportunity was\nrelease for the next application cycle. Overall, ACU described its experience with the\nevidence-based planning grants as eye-opening in terms of the steps to build a\nprogram. One of the challenges it faced throughout the process was\nunderstanding the AmeriCorps program structure and terminology, which were\nessential for designing a program that fit within AmeriCorps. The team\nrecommends that any future grantees be prepared to hit the ground running and\nreach out to everyone in the AmeriCorps community for recommendations on\nplanning a program with members. While it can feel a bit overwhelming at first,\nACU was grateful for the Knowledge Network, current grantees, and its program\nofficer for the support to make its program design successful. In September, ACU successfully completed its planning grant\nperiod and submitted its grantee progress report. The team did not seek\nadditional funding opportunities. Campus Compact of the\nMountain West Throughout the evidence-based planning grant, Campus Compact of the Mountain West (CCMW) spent considerable time building potential partnerships that were essential to\nits Civic Futures program that supports students, kindergarten through higher\neducation (K2H). K2H Civic Futures seeks to work with these partners to\norganize education teams that enhance civic learning and engagement in\nstudents. Through these partnerships, CCMW built a strong pipeline of\ncontributors and facilitators for its Civic Futures program. CCMW was in a unique position. While in the midst of its\nplanning grant, CCMW also applied for \u2013 and eventually received \u2013 full funding\nfor program implementation. However, the approval for funding came two months\nlater than expected, which presented additional challenges during that period\nof uncertainty. The Civic Futures partners include K-12 principals, faculty,\nengagement staff, school counselors, and teachers; all of whom committed time\nand energy to the program development, so CCMW wanted to make sure their time\nand energy were honored, regardless of funding outcome. It also meant keeping\nthese partners and the internal team focused and motivated to continue work, so\nthey were ready to proceed at a moment\u2019s notice. Still, CCMW found the time of the planning grant to be\ninvaluable. As one employee at CCMW put it: \u201cI seriously believe that planning\ngrants should be part and parcel of any new national service program to allow\nfor in-depth program planning, evaluation planning, and partnership\ndevelopment.\u201d The team encouraged other grantees to ask as many questions as\npossible to CNCS research and evaluation staff to get a firm understanding\nabout expectations and possibilities around research and evaluation for CNCS programs. Toward the end of the grant, CCMW worked with faculty in\nResearch Methods and Information Science at the Morgridge College of Education\nat the University of Denver to design and implement a comprehensive evaluation\nof the Civic Futures program. Since then, CCMW has finalized all of the\npartnerships for its Civic Futures program. More recently, it is working to\nrecruit AmeriCorps members for all of the partnership sites, provide\norientation and training to members and site supervisors, and ultimately get\nthe program off the ground. CCMW is looking forward to the grant cycle and making\nsome headway with civic learning and engagement initiatives across the region. Children\u2019s Forum (The\nForum) The Children\u2019s Forum\n(The Forum) had a busy couple of months as it wrapped up work on its\nprogram to train AmeriCorps volunteers to serve as coaches for early learning\nprograms. In that time, it developed and refined a projected budget for the\nprogram, prepared a plan for member orientation and training, and outlined a\ndetailed logic model that incorporates intervention, assessment, and data collection\ncomponents into the program. The Forum also continued to engage its advisory\nteam members as well as other community and state partners to inform the\nprogram development efforts. As the grant came to an end, The Forum focused its attention\non the feasibility of recruiting diverse individuals to serve in the early\nlearning program, as building the diversity in this area was an overarching\ngoal of theirs. The team also worked to determine how to pilot its intervention\nmodel in steps in order to estimate the likelihood of success. One of the biggest opportunities from the grant was the\nability to work with community and state partners. The Forum appreciated the\nsupport and insight provided by those partners, which also helped reinforce the\nneed and importance of such an early learning model. At the same time though,\nthe inclusion of so many partners presented challenges, as it became difficult\nto bring all of them together to work on the program. Despite that challenge,\nThe Forum still recommends other grantees engage a broad group of community\npartners to secure buy in and support. At the end of the grant, The Forum was looking to make more\nprogress in selecting communities to participate in its program before it moved\nto piloting its program. The Forum felt that ensuring those communities have an\nengaged and diverse workforce will allow it to be most successful in meeting\nthe goals and objectives of the program. Although the Forum is no longer\nparticipating in a grant, it is continuing to evaluate and seek funding\nopportunities for the future.
