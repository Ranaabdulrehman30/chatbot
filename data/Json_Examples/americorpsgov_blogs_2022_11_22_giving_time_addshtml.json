This giving season, join with AmeriCorps to answer the president\u2019s call to create a more united, stronger nation by donating the gift of time. Why Give Time When it comes to giving your time, no gift is too small because every act of service makes a difference. Whether it\u2019s two hours volunteering at a food bank, 20 hours organizing a park clean-up, or 1,700 hours serving as a mentor with AmeriCorps, every second counts. In addition to positively impacting others, volunteering is a mood booster, skill builder, and people connector. Research conducted by the National Institutes of Health and the U niversity of Exeter found volunteering reduces the likelihood of high blood pressure. According to another NIH study, volunteers are more likely to live longer than non-volunteers . Serving others also promotes human connection, a greater sense of purpose, and more happiness over time . AmeriCorps members and volunteers routinely find opportunities to develop new skills, make professional connections, stand out in the job market, and increase employment opportunities . Volunteering is a multi-purpose tool that allows people to find common ground and bridge divides. How You Can Give Time You can start by addressing a vital need in your community, like expanding access to healthy, fresh food or creating safe, green spaces. Or find a cause that matters to you. Whether you\u2019re serving as a tutor to close the gap in our education system or restoring a trail to reduce wildfires and fight the climate crisis, you can make a difference in many ways. 5 Ways You Can Take Action Nominate your favorite volunteer as an AmeriCorps Uniter.
