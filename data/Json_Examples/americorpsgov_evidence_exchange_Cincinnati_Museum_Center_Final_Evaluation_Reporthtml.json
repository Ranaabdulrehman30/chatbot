To accomplish these aims, ECSITE relies on an approach often described as \u201csciencing,\" which encourages the integration of science experiences across other curriculum domains through an enriched environment, planned lessons, and incidental conversations with children. Evaluation of the ECSITE program focused on assessing both program implementation and its preliminary outcomes. The study found that: In most cases, implementation goals for high levels of teacher, parent and child participation, easy availability of materials and resources, and consistent replication in the integration of science inquiry approaches across multiple classroom domains were met. In many cases, outcome goals for increased rates of teacher comfort and competency in the preparation of science and math lessons, high rates of parent involvement and participation in transition services, appropriate developmental progress for children, and enrollment in quality preschool were met or exceeded. Of particular note, a large majority of parents participating in the survey (88%) reported that they believe science is either \u201cvery important\u201d or somewhat important for their children\u2019s school readiness. In addition, there were significant increases in teacher\u2019s math and science confidence from the beginning to the end of each academic year.
