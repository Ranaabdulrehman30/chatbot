What We Do Disaster Services Unit Active Disaster Response Economic Opportunity Education Environmental Stewardship Healthy Futures COVID-19 Veterans and Military Families Veterans and Military Families Our veterans have given much in service of this nation and AmeriCorps believes that our nation has a sacred obligation to care for veterans and their families after they separate from service. AmeriCorps shares this belief and has made serving and engaging veterans and military families one of its priority focus areas. AmeriCorps programs recruit veterans, particularly those who are transitioning from military to civilian life, into service opportunities, including those that utilize military experience. Veterans who serve in AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors gain valuable professional, educational, and life benefits, and the experience can have a lasting impact. AmeriCorps\u2019 Dual Mission National service programs are proud to have the dual honor of serving our veterans and serving beside them.

Engaging Veterans in Service National service is an effective way to tap the talent and leadership skills of veterans to solve problems at home. More than 13,000 veterans serve in AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors programs each year, applying the skills they acquired in the military to serve their communities by responding to disasters, building homes, mentoring at-risk youth, and supporting other veterans, and more. Research finds service provides specific benefits to military service members transitioning to civilian life\u2014comradery, teamwork, and help address community needs, which help veterans re-connect to their communities. Further, studies show that veterans and their families are more likely to accept assistance offered by an individual affiliated with the military than a civilian volunteer, making the \u201cvets helping vets\u201d model particularly effective.
