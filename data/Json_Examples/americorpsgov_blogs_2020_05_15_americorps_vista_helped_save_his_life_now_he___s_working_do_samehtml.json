Now He\u2019s Working to Do the Same. Submitted by admin on Fri, 05/15/2020 - 09:03 May 15, 2020 Nicole Jackson Nothing went horribly wrong for Mikah Wagner to end up at a homeless shelter at 19. A fight with his stepmom and no other place to go led him to a youth shelter, a place he was grateful for, but also a place where he struggled. A few years later, this is the exact message he wants to get through to people: \u201cIt can happen to anybody so quickly. People don\u2019t really understand how quickly you can fall into this place where you feel like you have no options, and then you\u2019re trapped.\u201d It was this passion for sharing his story through public speaking and advocacy that led Mikah to AmeriCorps VISTA, an experience he would later call \u201cmagical.\u201d While speaking at a conference, Mikah was invited to help lead a new initiative: Metro Denver Homeless Initiative\u2019s (MDHI) Youth Action Board, where young adults who have experienced homelessness work to use their knowledge and expertise to improve how youth services are provided. Within months of joining, the team at MDHI invited Mikah to be part of its AmeriCorps VISTA program. The AmeriCorps VISTA program came into Mikah\u2019s life at a time when he desired to do something that mattered. This was his opportunity to not only help the voices of youth with lived experience to be heard, but it was also his chance to commit himself fully to something of significance. AmeriCorps VISTA was his opportunity to gain direction and the life skills he felt he had been missing. He jumped in, continuing the work he started with the Youth Action Board, and took on new responsibilities that included helping support MDHI\u2019s committees, helping to manage the organization\u2019s last resort funding stream for those trying to get into housing, and the Point-in-Time, an annual count of people experiencing homelessness in the area. Being an AmeriCorps VISTA coupled with the opportunity to support a group he knew so well, empowered Mikah. His work helped make change happen - to policies, to the way people thought, and to the way equity was approached. As Mikah\u2019s year of service was coming to an end, he had a \u201csurreal experience.\u201d He went back to the youth shelter where he had stayed and served breakfast. \u201cBeing able to give service to people who are in a situation very similar to my own a few years ago brought me a huge amount of pride.\u201d Hearing Mikah talk about his experience as an AmeriCorps VISTA is like hearing someone explain how it felt winning the lottery: \u201cVISTA saved my life in a lot of ways.\u201d He does have a word of caution to those thinking of joining AmeriCorps VISTA: \u201cVISTA is fantastic if you approach it the way it needs to be approached. If you give yourself for a year to really commit to something and help it benefit your community, it\u2019s an invaluable opportunity to learn a lot of skills, learn about a community, and influence how programs in your community are assisting people. It\u2019s magical.\u201d Mikah is now an employee at MDHI, where he serves as the Operations and Administrative Assistant. Due to COVID-19, his organization is working from home while also continuing their work for the Denver metro community. They have put together resource guides and have led online trainings to support those who work in homeless services better serve their communities through the COVID-19 pandemic. Having experienced life at a homeless shelter, he knows the dangers people are facing dealing with a highly transmittable virus while in a shelter. Although Mikah sees the strain communities are going through and will continue to face, he is hopeful. When asked for inspiration particularly for those who will be facing a new reality, Mikah\u2019s parting words were a reminder of his will to not only survive but thrive: \u201cWe have to go back to living.\u201d Previous May 14 Update: AmeriCorps and Senior Corps COVID-19 Response Next May 22 Update: AmeriCorps and Senior Corps COVID-19 Response Back to main content Sign up to hear about our latest news, events, and opportunities.
