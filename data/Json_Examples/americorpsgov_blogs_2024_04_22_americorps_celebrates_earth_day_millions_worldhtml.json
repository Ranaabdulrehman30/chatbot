A launch of a new generation of leaders and service projects to preserve our natural resources are a few ways AmeriCorps is participating in the observance to create a greener and cleaner planet. President Biden's New American Climate Corps In September 2023, President Biden announced the launch of the American Climate Corps, a groundbreaking initiative modeled after Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Civilian Conservation Corps that will put more than 20,000 young Americans to work fighting the impacts of climate change today while gaining the skills they need to join the growing clean energy and climate-resilience workforce of tomorrow. This Earth Day, AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith joins President Biden, our nation\u2019s leaders, AmeriCorps members and national service champions to highlight the unique opportunities the ACC will\u00a0offer to young adults through thousands of conservation, climate resilience, and renewable energy opportunities. The inaugural class of ACC will tackle the impacts of climate change today while learning skills needed to be part of the clean energy and climate-resilience workforce of tomorrow. As the hub for ACC, AmeriCorps will support the program to combat climate change, foster environmental sustainability, and expand pathways to clean jobs. New Yorkers Protect Their Environment Through Service Image Caption AmeriCorps members serving the Environmental Justice Corps Image Caption AmeriCorps member serving the Environmental Justice Corps Image Caption AmeriCorp members serving the Environmental Justice Corps Previous Next In September 2023, the Service Collaborative launched the Environmental Justice Corps to address two prevalent gaps in the Buffalo, N.Y., community \u2013 infrastructure inequities and the unemployment and underemployment of young adults. EJC recruits AmeriCorps members from historically underserved communities in East Buffalo to provide job training, help mitigate flood damage caused by stormwater, and provide safe drinking water. The EJC has created a pipeline for members to find full-time employment. Through their service, AmeriCorps members enhance the community's health and safety, get hands-on experience, and engage in career readiness training. From networking to sharing a meal and learning about the importance of the day and the history of environmental stewardship initiatives in Western New York, including the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative's successful cleanup of areas along the Buffalo River, AmeriCorps members will participate in a variety of efforts to revitalize local green and open spaces through EJC this Earth Day. The Green Team of Florida Image Caption AmeriCorps member serving with the Green Team Image Caption AmeriCorps member serving with the Green Team Image Caption AmeriCorps members serving with the Green Team Previous Next In January 2023, Tampa, Fla., launched Green Team , the first city-sponsored environmental stewardship program, to make the community and Earth a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable place. From planting trees to removing invasive species, cleaning green spaces, and providing climate change education, AmeriCorps members with Green Team make a difference in their communities and environments every day. In honor of Earth Day, AmeriCorps members of Green Team have been supporting various service projects across the city throughout the week. The Green Team completed oyster reef installations to protect the living shoreline and provided community education at the Museum of Science & Industry ahead of the observance. On Earth Day, the Green Team is planting and expanding the footprint of a pollinator garden in Rowlett Park to help create a wandering wildflower garden for community members to enjoy as they stroll the park trail. AmeriCorps members will also be serving to help remove trash and marine debris from several sites in and around Port Tampa Bay. Join the Fight and Create History Whether you're a recent graduate, a seasoned professional looking to pivot into a meaningful career, or someone eager to contribute to environmental solutions, anyone can combat climate change. Join millions of Americans in service to make a difference and help create a sustainable future.
