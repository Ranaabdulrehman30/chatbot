To date, her efforts have reached 900 members and volunteers from all four AmeriCorps signature programs (State and National, VISTA, NCCC, and AmeriCorps Seniors) and served more than 50,000 Coloradans. \u201cWe are honored to celebrate Heather\u2019s partnership with national service to fight the spread of COVID in this great state,\u201d said Ken Goodson, AmeriCorps regional administrator for the mountain region. \u201cThe Colorado COVID Containment Corps has been a huge success, and one that could not have happened without a trusted partner like Heather in the Colorado Department of Public Health.\u201d Heather helped to create this collaborative public health corps and maintain/improve it through the worst periods of COVID-19 in Colorado. She captained a ship with a diverse crew of partners \u2013 Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Gary Community Investments, Serve Colorado, and AmeriCorps. Through hiring efforts, Heather\u2019s team retained 84 alumni as full-time, paid contact tracers during a national crisis. Thanks to Heather and her team, Colorado has maintained strong, innovative, service-based surge capacity for contact tracing and case investigation. Heather also maintained data transparency, working to educate and inform AmeriCorps and its partners about the most recent developments in this public health battle. \u201cAt AmeriCorps, we know it\u2019s our people\u2014often behind the scenes\u2014who make great things happen,\u201d said Goodson. \u201cAnd while Heather may have served under a different organization, she certainly has earned her AmeriCorps \u201cA\u201d for stepping up when her state needed her.\u201d Heather, who earned advanced degrees in public health and medical anthropology, also is an international service alumna through Peace Corps where she worked on health-based initiatives in Ghana from 2012-14. She is primed to continue her service journey with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\u2014and continue to #GetThingsDone.
