Also known as African American Independence Day, Jubilee Day or Freedom Day, Juneteenth is the oldest national celebration of the emancipation of enslaved Black people in America. What is Juneteenth? Juneteenth is a significant day for Americans because people of all races, nationalities, and religions come together to acknowledge the history that built our country\u2019s foundation. It serves as a reminder of our capacity emerge from our darkest moments with purpose and resolve to work together to build a better tomorrow. On April 9, 1865, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Virginia, ending the Civil War. However, slavery didn\u2019t end until June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger announced in Galveston, Texas, that all slaves were free in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Today, we reflect on our nation\u2019s past to learn how can further advance racial equity and heal current divisions. How do you celebrate Juneteenth?
