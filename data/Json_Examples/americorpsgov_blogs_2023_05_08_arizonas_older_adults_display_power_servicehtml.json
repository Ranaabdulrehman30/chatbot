They tap into their life experiences to help address critical needs in their communities. During Older Americans Month, we join the nation to recognize and thank older adults for their invaluable contributions from coast to coast. More than 4,000 AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers at 500 service sites are giving back across Arizona. Older Arizonians, ages 55 and older, who serve with AmeriCorps programs come from all walks of life\u2014finding themselves united in turning their compassion into action. At Northern Arizona University Center for Service and Volunteerism and Arizona State University Lodestar Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Innovation, AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers step in to help fellow older adults continue to live independently while others use their talents to help children thrive in and out of classrooms. AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith meeting with AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers in Arizona A support system for fellow older adults Through the Senior Companion Program, Rosemary befriends and assists older adults. For more than 15 years, she has helped her companions with everyday tasks. She lends her language skills to help translate for Spanish speakers and provides friendship to others. Her kind and friendly nature is a beacon of light for those facing loneliness, especially for an older woman who recently lost her husband. Under Rosemary's guidance, this woman was able to reengage with her community and form new connections. Rosemary's contributions to her community are truly commendable.

Smith In ASU\u2019s Experience Matters AmeriCorps Seniors RSVP program, older adults provide transportation to medical appointments, grocery shopping, errands, and more. These AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers support older adults to meet their needs and help advance their dignity and quality of life\u2014a great way to give back. Fostering the next generation Foster Grandma Jesusa with AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith Jesusa, an Arizona native, spent her childhood helping her parents pick cotton from fields. Although she couldn't attend high school or college, she dreamed of becoming a teacher. But this doesn\u2019t stop a woman with passion. Despite the hardships she faced, Jesusa has served more than 18,000 hours in the Foster Grandparent Program, helping children thrive in classrooms. She tutors and mentors fourth graders through the Northern Arizona University Center for Service and Volunteerism, and her enthusiasm for teaching is evident in her work. Foster Grandpa Fred with his students Fred, a retired police officer, has dedicated over 15 years of his life to the Foster Grandparent program. Throughout his career as a police officer, Fred recognized the crucial role of mentorship, particularly for children facing unique challenges. He knew that just one person could have a lasting, positive impact\u2014so he raised his hand to help. Today, \"Grandpa Fred,\" as he's affectionately known, works with first and second graders, providing guidance and support to help them learn and build their confidence. Make a difference.
