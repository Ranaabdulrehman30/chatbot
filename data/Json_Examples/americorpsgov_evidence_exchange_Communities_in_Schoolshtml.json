Two Years of Case Management: Final Findings from the Communities in Schools Random Assignment Evaluation (see links above right for full documents) This report presents the final implementation and impact findings from a two-year randomized\u00a0controlled trial of CIS\u00a0case management. CIS case-managed students participated in support\u00a0activities more frequently than non-case-managed\u00a0students overall; Case management had a positive\u00a0effect on several nonacademic outcomes, including students\u2019 attitudes about school and their\u00a0relationships with adults and peers; however,? Case management did not\u00a0improve students\u2019 school progress, achievement, attendance, or behavior. Using Integrated Student Supports to Keep Kids in School: A Quasi-Experimental Evaluation of Communities in Schools (see links above right for full documents) This study examines the CIS model\u2019s effect on students\u2019 outcomes in elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. It compares 53 CIS schools in Texas and North Carolina with 78 matched comparison schools. Findings: For the high schools, on-time graduation rates increased \u2014 and dropout rates decreased \u2014 in the study schools after the CIS model was launched. Graduation and dropout rates also improved in the comparison schools, so it is unclear whether the CIS model was more effective than the strategies used by the comparison schools. In elementary schools, attendance rates improved in schools implementing the CIS model more than they did in a group of similar, comparison schools. It was not possible to evaluate whether the CIS model improved middle school students' behavior outcomes. There was no effect on attendance in middle and high schools. There was no effect on test scores in elementary and high schools. In middle schools, English/language arts test scores did not improve in schools implementing the CIS model, whereas they did improve in a group of similar, comparison middle schools.
