What We Do Disaster Services Unit Active Disaster Response Economic Opportunity Education Environmental Stewardship Healthy Futures COVID-19 Veterans and Military Families The Disaster Services Unit (DSU) leads the agency\u2019s engagement across the disaster services cycle with federal, state, local, nonprofit, and other partners. The DSU\u2019s role as the central hub for the agency\u2019s disaster-related activities ensures that AmeriCorps engagement in this area is appropriate, consistent, and coordinated. The DSU also provides technical assistance before, during, and after a disaster. This includes but is not limited to national service roles and functions in the disaster cycle, accessing national service support, volunteer and donations management, disaster response and recovery planning, disaster partnership building; and training support. Active and Recent Responses AmeriCorps\u2019 expertly trained Disaster Response Team serves in national disaster response efforts by supporting shelter operations, call centers, volunteer and donation management, muck and gut operations, blue-roof tarping and debris cleanup, among other services. FIND OUT MORE \u201cI\u2019ve been working with AmeriCorps volunteers for over a decade and they are some of the most flexible, hard-working and dedicated volunteers advancing FEMA\u2019s mission helping people before, during and after disasters.\u201d - Gonzalo Hern\u00e1ndez Emergency Management Specialist | Mass Care/Emergency Assistance | Individual Assistance | Recovery Directorate How AmeriCorps Responds National Response Framework (NRF) AmeriCorps, through the DSU, is part of the NRF. The NRF is a guide to how the nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies. It is built on scalable, flexible, and adaptable concepts identified in the National Incident Management System to align key roles and responsibilities across the nation. This Framework describes specific authorities and best practices for managing incidents that range from the serious but purely local to large-scale terrorist attacks or catastrophic natural disasters. The National Response Framework describes the principles, roles, responsibilities, and coordinating structures for responding to an incident and how response efforts integrate with those of the other mission areas. National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) As the NRF serves as the national guide for disaster response, the NDRF serves as the guide for long-term recovery and is supported by the continual development of detailed field guidance, and training tools. The NDRF describes the concepts and principles that promote effective federal recovery assistance. AmeriCorps provides a support to the NDRF through the Recovery Support Functions. The NDRF captures resources, capabilities, and best practices for recovering from a disaster. It recognizes that significant challenges confront all recovery efforts, from a relatively localized incident to a large-scale disaster that demands substantial allocation of resources. Importantly, the NDRF is intended to address of all kinds of disasters, both big and small,\u00a0whether it is Presidentially declared or not. Through its connection with the National Planning Frameworks, including the National Response Framework and the National Disaster Recovery Framework, AmeriCorps is positioned to be a leader in the disaster community. FEMA Mission Assignment Development In a federally declared disaster, the DSU will work with state and federal partners to identify unmet needs. In developing a Mission Assignment, the DSU will identify unmet needs, develop a timeframe for response, and provide technical assistance to both State and FEMA partners. AmeriCorps Disaster Response Teams (A-DRTs) ADRTs are AmeriCorps programs that have a heightened focus and commitment to disaster response and recovery. A-DRTs engage in activities and trainings year-round, are a nationally deployable resource, and are recognized in the emergency management community as leaders in volunteer management. AmeriCorps Members and AmeriCorps Seniors Volunteers One of our key areas is disaster response and recovery and our programs have long since been the first to respond and the last the leave. AmeriCorps NCCC FEMA Corps is a disaster-assistance focused track of AmeriCorps NCCC that is directly deployable by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). AmeriCorps Seniors RSVP engages 55 and over volunteers in each stage of disaster response. Serve with Us Interested in disaster response service with AmeriCorps?
