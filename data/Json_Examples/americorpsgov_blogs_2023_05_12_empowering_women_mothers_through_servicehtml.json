These dedicated individuals serve in communities throughout the US at organizations helping women receive the care they need, like Maggie\u2019s Place \u2013 a community-based organization that helps pregnant and parenting women and their children experiencing homelessness in a safe space. Through various programs and services, AmeriCorps members offer assistance where it is needed the most, such as housing, counseling, parenting, child enrichment, health and wellness, and more.\u00a0 Their presence creates a safe and welcoming community. A Future Healthcare Professional in the Making AmeriCorps member Isabella joined Maggie\u2019s Place after graduating from Indiana University to gain meaningful life experiences as a future healthcare professional. There\u2019s never a dull day for Isabella during her service. From sunset walks with moms to driving them to job interviews, rocking babies to sleep, and supporting soon-to-be moms during labor, Isabella learns new skills and creates meaningful relationships daily. \"Experiencing life with other women and learning from each other is one of my favorite things in this world. I am grateful for all the lessons, life hacks, and deep talks that I get to have with my amazing AmeriCorps cohort and the women we serve,\" said AmeriCorps member Isabella. Jessica followed her passion as an aspiring doula and joined Maggie\u2019s Place to serve others. As a children and families major at Eastern Michigan University, Jessica adapts to different roles, such as a friend, confidant, advocate, or whomever mothers need most. She supports them from pregnancy to childbirth through postpartum, providing them with the resources to help them acclimate to their new role\u2014motherhood. \u201cMy top memorable moments are when the moms come home from the hospital after giving birth and seeing them enter mommy mode. Through the sleep deprivation, hormonal fluctuations, the less-than-ideal circumstances, the amount of unconditional love and care they have for their babies is heartwarming,\" said AmeriCorps member Jessica. A Reward for Returning AmeriCorps Member After completing her service term, AmeriCorps member Diana joined Maggie\u2019s Place as a team leader. Diana decided to recommit to service because she felt she could do more to help the women at Maggie\u2019s Place. Diana supports new mothers every day, from looking after newborns to helping create a sense of belonging by organizing first holiday celebrations for moms and their babies. For many of the women at Maggie\u2019s Place, holidays are difficult times. Diana helps prepare food, gifts, and a safe place for the moms and babies to feel special and loved. \u201cThere is something magical about a room full of people who were recently strangers coming together to create new traditions and celebrate each other during one of the most meaningful times of the year,\u201d said AmeriCorps member Diana. An Unforgettable Bond Nikole went to Maggie\u2019s Place when she was pregnant with her daughter. Originally from Las Vegas, Nikole lived in Mexico for the last 20 years And Diana was one of first of the three AmeriCorps members to welcome her to Maggie\u2019s Place. \u201cI\u2019ve never been alone at Maggie\u2019s Place. One of the AmeriCorps members was with me when I gave birth to my daughter, and she cut the umbilical cord. That night was New Year\u2019s Eve and we watched fireworks together with my newborn daughter from the hospital window,\u201d said Nikole. A Support System for Mothers and Children Whether they organize donations for diapers, provide mental health counseling services, or help care for newborns, AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers give these women, and many more, the support, confidence and compassion they need, when they need it most.
