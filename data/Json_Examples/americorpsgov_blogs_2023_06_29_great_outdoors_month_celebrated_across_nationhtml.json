Nearly 60 years after the inception of the Civilian Conservation Corps under former President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, AmeriCorps was created to help address the nation\u2019s immediate challenges, including conservation and preservation efforts. Today, AmeriCorps functions as a modern-day Civilian Conservation Corps that is more diverse, accessible, and focused on 21st-century environmental challenges. In 2021, AmeriCorps engaged more than 16,000 AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers who improved more than 400,000 acres of parks and public land, treated 14,500 miles of trails and rivers, restored 1,000 structures after natural disasters, weatherized 7,000 housing units and public structures, and provided critical assistance after floods, fires, hurricanes, and other disasters. With the support of our nation\u2019s leaders, AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers continue to fight the effects of climate change to conserve and preserve our great outdoors to this day. Recently, AmeriCorps\u2019 conversation work was celebrated across the nation during Great Outdoors Month by President Biden and other partners. National Service and Conservation Corps Day This month marked the inaugural National Service and Conservation Corps Day , designated by Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and AmeriCorps alumnus Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM). More than 150 AmeriCorps members joined the celebration, serving alongside volunteers, the National Park Service, the US Forest Service, and the Department of Interior in Washington, DC, helping remove invasive species, participating in debris cleanup, supporting repairs, and more. \u201cI served as an AmeriCorps member for the US Fish and Wildlife Service early in my career. It reinforced the importance of working in service to our nation and the people and places that make our nation so special,\u201d said Senator Heinrich. \u201cAs vice chair of the National Service Congressional Caucus, \u201cI am proud to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure each new generation of Americans has their own opportunities to serve and leave their mark.\u201d AmeriCorps members participating in the National Service and Conservation Corps Day The National Service and Conservation Corps Day supports AmeriCorps\u2019 efforts to lift up the thousands of Americans who serve outdoors and inspire more to join our fight to combat climate change. President Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom Recognize AmeriCorps Member\u2019s Passion for Service This month also gave one AmeriCorps member, Chiena, a once-in-a-lifetime moment. President Biden joined California Governor Gavin Newsom in Palo Alto, Calif., to deliver his remarks on the climate crisis. During the address, Governor Newsome recognized Chiena, who serves with California Climate Action Corps for her dedication to combatting climate change and addressing food security in underserved communities. AmeriCorps member Chiena with President Biden Chiena had the opportunity to share her service story and introduce President Biden who said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic in my life. And the reason I\u2019m optimistic is because of this generation. It\u2019s the best educated, the most engaged, the most involved, and the most consequential.\u201d And that is why you are also so critical to the climate movement. Get Outside and Make a Difference for Our Environment Whether you\u2019re a recent college graduate like Chiena, a professional looking for a career change, or an older adult who just retired and is looking to stay active \u2013 there are opportunities for all Americans to get involved and make a positive impact. Choose AmeriCorps and join our nation\u2019s fight to address the lasting effects of climate change and celebrate the great outdoors.
