During these extraordinary times, AmeriCorps members have provided extraordinary service by keeping our kids in school and on track, and helping our communities build back stronger than before. Please join me in continuing to celebrate these accomplishments throughout AmeriCorps Week, as we thank those who serve and support national service across our country and encourage others to follow in their footsteps. I hit the road over the weekend visiting Mississippi and Louisiana and I am looking forward to continuing visiting program sites this week in Alabama, DC, Virginia, and Minnesota to see the power of service in action. Get ready to show off your AmeriCorps gear Thursday on #DayOfTheA and stay tuned for the latest AmeriCorps Week news. Thank you for all your contributions to advance our mission. I am proud to be part of this team and all the work being done in communities around the country. Happy AmeriCorps Week! In Service, Michael AmeriCorps members and volunteers bring hope and opportunity to families and communities that need it most.
