From coast to coast, our members serving in the AmeriCorps NCCC program travel as a team to support: environmental conservation; climate resilience; as well as disaster recovery in affected communities. Since 2000, AmeriCorps NCCC teams have assisted more than 20.6 million people in disaster areas, recruited or coordinated nearly 940,000 volunteers, and protected more than 1.6 million acres of land through firefighting and fire management. Environmental crusaders Young adults serving in the AmeriCorps NCCC program as traditional corps members support at least four projects in different states and cities for 10 months. These members make a positive impact in the areas of energy conservation, infrastructure improvement, natural and other disaster services, and urban and rural development. AmeriCorps members share why they joined AmeriCorps NCCC traditional corps AmeriCorps members in the program support conservation projects where young adults unite as a team to support projects such as trail building, fence construction and maintenance, biodiversity protection, and more. Last summer, through the AmeriCorps Summer of Service \u2013 a three-month program where members joined hands-on, full-time projects for six weeks to support the environment \u2013 members served a total of 28,396 hours, restoring and constructing more than 28 miles of hiking trails, removing more than 17,000 pounds of debris and trash, harvesting 200 pounds of food, and more. A decade of responding to disasters Since the development of the AmeriCorps NCCC program in 1994, our members have often been the first on the ground for disaster response and the last to leave. Following the catastrophic tornado that devastated Joplin, Mo., in 2011 , AmeriCorps members from the NCCC program arrived within hours to help. From setting up a missing person hotline to opening a volunteer center encouraging others across the country to help, the teams played a crucial role in response and recovery efforts. AmeriCorps members\u2019 service during this time inspired the creation of FEMA Corps \u2013 an innovative, team-based national service program that provides 18 to 26\u2010year\u2010olds the opportunity to gain experience and training in emergency response while supporting immediate needs after a disaster for survivors and their communities. AmeriCorps members serving in FEMA Corps share how they make a difference in communities For the past decade, FEMA Corps supported disaster response efforts from hurricanes, wildfires, floods, windstorms, and more. Their service included supporting: Caldor Fire in August 2021. Members serving in FEMA Corps helped install erosion control materials to keep toxic run-off from further damage. COVID-19 pandemic response throughout 2021. FEMA Corps helped set up and run vaccination clinics across the country, providing wellness checks for individuals entering the facility and monitoring participants for side effects following vaccination. Hurricane Ian in 2022. FEMA Corps teams supported logistics, operations, disaster survivor assistance, and more. New Mexico wildfires and flooding in 2023. FEMA Corps teams deployed to assist with disaster response efforts. Celebrating the future generation of national service leaders AmeriCorps members serving in AmeriCorps NCCC programs are committed to helping our nation become greener and safer. These young adults are a vital support to our environmental stewardship and disaster response efforts. Through their service, our members help lead the next generation of climate crusaders and crisis responders. Ready to get things done with AmeriCorps NCCC? Start your AmeriCorps journey!
