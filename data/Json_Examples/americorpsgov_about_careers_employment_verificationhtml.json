Each employee is responsible for authorizing the release of their employment and salary information. Verifiers must receive an authorization code from you before they can access your information through The Work Number\u00ae. Once they receive the authorization code from you, the verifier goes to www.theworknumber.com where they can access (with our permission) the employment information they are requesting. What if I just need a letter to provide proof of income and employment? The Work Number\u00ae provides a self-service option that will allow you to provide income and employment information to credentialed verifiers outside of an income or employment verification request. Once you establish and log into your account at https://employees/theworknumber.com , navigate to the \u201cLetters\u201d tab for more information. Can members and volunteers use The Work Number\u00ae Service to verify their employment with AmeriCorps?
