AmeriCorps embraces these as guiding principles across our agency and programs. Collaboration improves the effectiveness of government by encouraging partnerships and cooperation within the federal government, across levels of government, and between the government and private institutions and citizens. Participation allows members of the public to contribute ideas and expertise so that their government can make policies with the benefit of a wide range of views and information. Transparency promotes accountability by providing the public with information about what the government is doing. Open Government Plan Version 1.1 Toggle Based on input from agency staff and the public, the AmeriCorps Open Government Plan contains detailed information on our current activities and future improvements to increase transparency, collaboration, and participation. This plan is a living document and we are interested in hearing from you about our plan. Please let us know what you think and share any other ideas on how we can improve transparency, participation, and collaboration by sending an email to open@americorps.gov . Open Government Plan 2014 Message on Release of Open Government Plan Open Government Press Release Record and Reports Toggle Regulations.gov was launched in January 2003 in order to provide public users access to federal regulatory content. On Regulations.gov, the public can search, submit comments, and download the agency's regulatory materials. Information Collections (Paperwork Reduction Act) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35; see 5 CFR Part 1320) requires that the Office of Management and Budget approve all collections of information by a Federal agency from the public before they can be implemented. Collections of information include (1) requests for information for transmission to the government, such as application forms and written report forms, (2) reporting or recordkeeping requirements, and (3) third-party or public disclosure requirements. \u00a0For assistance, please contact AmeriCorps\u2019 OMB Clearance Officer at infoquality@cns.gov .
