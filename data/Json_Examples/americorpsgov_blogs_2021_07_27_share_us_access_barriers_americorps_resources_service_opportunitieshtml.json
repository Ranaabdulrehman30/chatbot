As part of this plan, the agency pledged to create new national service opportunities, increase living allowances and other benefits for service members, and invest in nonprofit, Tribal, and community organizations supporting underserved communities. We know there is great demand for more opportunities to serve, more knowledge about existing opportunities, and fewer barriers to service among Americans. Meeting those demands will require bold action to ensure that every American can learn about and explore potential service opportunities. Understanding barriers to national service, our programs, and agency resources is a key step in advancing the national service movement. In accordance with Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021, AmeriCorps invites public comment from any interested party, including current and former AmeriCorps program award recipiences, regarding barriers that they or the communities they serve, face in accessing services and resources offered through any AmeriCorps program. We want to hear from you. Your insights into how we can better expand access to and interest in national service to even more Americans not only helps neighborhoods tackle the nation\u2019s toughest challenges together, but also renews a collective sense of community. You are invited to share this request with your friends, families, and colleagues. Public comments must be received electronically via the federal register no later than Monday, August 2, at midnight ET. We see time and time again that service within and across communities breaks down cultural barriers, builds respect, and strengthens collaboration, understanding, and dialogue. This is an effort worth expanding. And to do so, we need your feedback. With your insights, we can empower Americans by providing broader knowledge of service options, create a greater number of service opportunities, and push forward the national service movement. We hope to hear from you soon! Previous Participatory Research: An Equitable Approach to Community Engagement Next Honor. Serve. Unite.
