Every year, the country bands together to honor the lives lost and uplift their communities during the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance. Once again, hundreds of thousands of Americans came together to pack meals, clean up neighborhoods, assist first responders, and more this year to honor the lives lost that day. Our Nation\u2019s Leaders Join in Service from Coast to Coast From Arizona to New York, Washington, DC, and more, our nation\u2019s leaders served alongside AmeriCorps members and volunteers to honor the day. In Arizona, Governor Katie Hobbs joined the annual 9/11 Day event to help pack meals for community members in need. The Governor served alongside hundreds of Arizona volunteers. Today marks 23 years since the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001. Despite the immense tragedy, we found strength in unity. Volunteering to pack meals for those in need was a powerful reminder of that.
