Over 4,500 pounds of water chestnut were hand pulled from the pond in just one day, a volume of 14 cubic yards. This event was organized by the US Fish and Wildlife Service with support from The Nature Conservancy and Friends of the Bay. Native to Europe and Asia, water chestnut forms dense, floating mats on the water\u2019s surface while rooted to the bottom. The dense, floating mats restrict light availability, reduce the oxygen content of the water, and displace native vegetation important to area wildlife. Water chestnut is not only a looming ecological threat to Long Island\u2019s fresh waters, but it can also limit boating, fishing, and swimming and the mature seeds have sharp spines that can injure anyone who steps on them. The Refuge confirmed the infestation in June 2008 and acted rapidly to remove as much water chestnut as possible that summer season. \u201cIf left uncontrolled, it will cover the entire pond within a few years,\u201d remarked Azucena Ponce, refuge biologist for the Long Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Over the last two years, over 50 cubic yards of water chestnut have been pulled from the pond. \u201cA month ago the infestation was a little over a \u00bd acre in size and now it covers about an acre of this eight acre pond. A ten-fold increase of water chestnut plants in one year has been documented in other places in the United States. It is important to act now to control and eradicate this plant before it spreads to other freshwater environments on Long Island,\u201d stated Mr. Entrup. \u201cThere is no other place I\u2019d rather be today,\u201d stated Yoshana Silver, a volunteer from Bethpage New York. \u201cSo wonderful that through team work we were able to make such a difference! Look how much water chestnut is in that dumpster! It is important to protect all of Long Island\u2019s diverse natural resources. I know that eradicating invasive plants is not a one day job \u2013 it will likely take a few years to exhaust the seed bank but I am confident that the USFWS with help from volunteers and non-profits can get a handle on this population. I am willing to put in the hard work and others are too.\u201d Next Nominate a Hero for the 2013 Citizens Medal Back to main content Sign up to hear about our latest news, events, and opportunities.
