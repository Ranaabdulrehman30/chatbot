This donation was made possible through the leadership of U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy and Gov. John Bel Edwards, who helped facilitate the collection of the masks by the Louisiana National Guard from the AmeriCorps NCCC Southern Region Campus. \u201cI am grateful that the national service family was able to support our neighbors in Louisiana as they work to slow the spread of COVID-19 throughout the region,\" said Barbara Stewart, CEO of CNCS. \u201cEvery day, AmeriCorps members, Senior Corps volunteers, and their fellow Americans are helping communities respond to this emergency.\u201d \u201cI am thankful for the hard work being done by Senator Cassidy and Governor Edwards. In addition, I greatly appreciate the work by Lieutenant Governor Bill Nungesser who oversees the important work of Volunteer Louisiana, the state service commission which is a crucial partner of the AmeriCorps State and National program.\u201d To find out what you can do, follow the guidelines for slowing the spread of the coronavirus and check out our list of 10 ways you can safely serve your community .
