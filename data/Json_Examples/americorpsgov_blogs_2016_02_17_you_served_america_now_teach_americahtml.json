Throughout the country, more than 1,300 veterans continue to \u00a0serve their country as AmeriCorps members in high-need communities doing meaningful, mission-oriented work for the betterment of the country. As AmeriCorps members, veterans work to solve some of the biggest issues facing communities including wildlife conservation, fighting to end veteran homelessness, teaching in high-needs schools, providing disaster services, and managing nonprofit operations. Joseph Clay, a former Marine Corps Sergeant now serving in AmeriCorps through Teach For America, is just one example of the thousands of National Veterans Corps members that are continuing to make a difference in their country through national service. Teach For America has a 25 year history of engaging college graduates and young professionals to teach in high-needs schools to end education inequality. In 2012, Teach For America launched its \u00a0You Served For America, Now Teach For America \u00a0initiative to help bring more veterans, just like Clay, into the fight against educational inequity and in effort to help veterans and military families find their next opportunity in the service of our nation. Teach For America believes that Military veterans have unique experiences and leadership abilities that can add real value to the classroom. Prior to joining Teach For America, Clay was a Marine Corps Infantry Sergeant who led combat operations in Iraq. After completing his military service, Clay committed to join Teach For America and now serves as a math teacher in one of the highest needs areas in the country \u2013 Tulsa, Oklahoma \u2013 where his experience and leadership helps students break free from the cycle of poverty and set their sights on a brighter future. For Clay, teaching is gratifying because he easily identifies with the experiences of students in high-need schools and impoverished communities. As a child, he also endured the challenges of poverty, but also dreamed of one day changing his reality. These shared experiences with his students are a major reason why fighting to end educational inequality is so important to him. But shared experiences are not the only factor that motivated Clay to continue serving. He also credits his experiences as a Marine for inspiring his dedication to service and toward working for the betterment of the country. On June 16, 2006, Clay\u2019s life was forever changed when his convoy was ambushed outside of Ramadi, Iraq. Many in his convoy were killed in the attack, including two of Clay\u2019s best friends. Every person in the convoy was injured in the attack. Clay\u2019s vehicle struck an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and the injury he sustained that day serves as a constant reminder of just how lucky he was to walk away. He views Teach For America as an opportunity to honor the dedication and the sacrifice of the sixteen Marines from his unit that didn\u2019t make it back home. National service not only provides transitioning veterans with opportunities to apply their leadership and gain additional skills, but also provides veterans with a durable pathways to employment and long-term success. Clay is using he opportunity with Teach For America to provide him a pathway to meaningful employment and potentially a career in teaching. His leadership and dedication to service are emblematic of and embedded in the spirit of the National Veterans Corps. Teach For America is currently looking to recruit more veterans just like Clay to join the fight to end educational inequality and to teach for America.
