It is the technical body responsible for reviewing and approving changes to AmeriCorps\u2019 production IT environment. PCCB approval is required for a system or project to become operational.. IT Governance Policy and Plans Toggle AmeriCorps\u2019s IT governance and execution requirements are established in official Agency policy, processes, and procedures: Information Technology Management Policy: Establishes AmeriCorps\u2019 policies, programs, and procedures for IT management. The policy covers ten integrated functional areas of IT management that support the agency\u2019s key business activities and outlines IT roles and responsibilities. Information Technology Governance Policy: Establishes AmeriCorps\u2019 IT governance policy and processes for efficient, effective, ongoing IT investments and programs. It guides the agency in aligning IT activities with its strategic direction and program needs and sets forth oversight of IT systems\u2019 implementation.

Systems Development Lifecycle Policy: Sets forth policies and procedures that AmeriCorps employees and contractors must follow when they procure, develop, implement, operate, and dispose of IT systems, including websites and applications. This includes requirements for IT project milestone reviews. Data Management Policy: Sets forth roles and responsibilities of the AmeriCorps offices and personnel involved in data and information management. The policy guides the offices as they plan, collect, process, disseminate, share, safeguard, and evaluate data and information, and establishes requirements for regularly assessing the quality of AmeriCorps data and information. IT Governance Execution Toggle AmeriCorps\u2019s Office of Information Technology is responsible for executing agency IT functions, delivering IT services, and administering the IT Governance Program.
