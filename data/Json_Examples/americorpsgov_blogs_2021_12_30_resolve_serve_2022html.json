At AmeriCorps our list of special people continues to grow. We have the privilege of working and serving with so many Americans who prioritize making an impact in their communities --turning compassion into action by building a culture of service makes this country great. As the year comes to an end, we wanted to express our thanks and share three actions you can take with us this holiday season. 1. Express Gratitude. AmeriCorps members work hard every day to make an impact on their community. Let\u2019s take a moment to say thanks to those who serve. 2. Reflect on 2021. As we count down to 2022 there is so much to be proud of when looking at the past year. As a result of hard work and commitment, some of AmeriCorps' successes in 2021 include: Thousands of Americans stepping up to serve on MLK Day . Volunteers made time on the MLK Day of Service to engage with their communities virtually and in-person while honoring the legacy of Dr. King. From cleaning up a public space to mentoring a young person, or assisting those who are food insecure, their time made a world of difference. MLK Day 2022 is just around the corner. Check out our new resources . Continuing support of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts . Since the start of the pandemic, AmeriCorps members served more than 4 million hours to support our nation\u2019s COVID-19 response and recovery.\u00a0This included supporting vaccination, contact tracing, testing, wellness checks, and other public health strategies; assisting food banks and meal delivery programs; and helping students stay on track through virtual teaching, tutoring, mentoring, and other services. Implementing new resources through the American Rescue Plan . This included increasing the AmeriCorps living allowance in VISTA and State and National programs and AmeriCorps Seniors stipend in Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion programs, supporting Child Tax Credit outreach and enrollment, and expanding the size of AmeriCorps programs and agency staff. Launching a new grant opportunity, Public Health AmeriCorps . In partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this AmeriCorps program is a $400 million investment over five years that will add capacity to strained public health systems and build a career pipeline for public health leaders. Uniting in service on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 Day . On the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance volunteers stepped forward on the 20th anniversary to help others in tribute to those killed and injured on September 11, 2001, first responders, and the countless others who serve to defend the nation\u2019s freedom at home and around the globe. These acts of service were giant acts of patriotism. 3. Resolve to Serve. Have you made a resolution for 2022 yet? How about service? Serving individually or with family or friends brings not only change to your community but provides ongoing benefits to you, too. If you don\u2019t know where to start, jump in the first month of the year by volunteering on MLK Day on Monday, Jan. 17. If you are resolving to serve in 2022, let us know about it. Share your service story with AmeriCorps. Thank you for all you do to make an impact on your communities each and every day. We at AmeriCorps wish you and your family a prosperous New Year, and a 2022 filled with getting things done.
