They\u2019ll conduct contact tracing and other important work to help Colorado reopen and get people back to work. CNCS is supporting this effort by redeploying AmeriCorps NCCC members and providing nearly $2 million in federal funding for new AmeriCorps VISTA Summer Associates and Senior Corps volunteers. Gary Community Investments has secured the technology and equipment necessary for the virtual service required by the unique circumstances. Details of the project include: 300 AmeriCorps NCCC members, based out of the Southwest Region Campus in Aurora, will start immediately 350 VISTA Summer Associates will be hosted by the Community Resource Center in Denver and Conservation Legacy in Durango, both existing AmeriCorps VISTA projects 100-200 additional Senior Corps volunteers will join the Senior Corps RSVP projects at Cultivate and Volunteers of America, Colorado Branch in Denver The AmeriCorps members and Senior Corps volunteers included in this project will join the many who, despite the obstacles presented by social distancing, have acted quickly and creatively to continue their critical work in new ways, or pivot to meet emerging needs. To date, more than 9,000 AmeriCorps and Senior Corps members have responded to COVID-19 , providing assistance to more than 1.3 million people. Organizations are currently recruiting for the new positions announced today, the first of which begin on June 22. Those who serve as VISTA Summer Associates will earn a stipend and an education award at the end of their service.
