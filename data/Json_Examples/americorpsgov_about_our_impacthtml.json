At AmeriCorps, we view evidence building as an ongoing cycle, and incorporate the process into our work across the agency through four phases: innovation, implementation, improvement, and expanded impact. AmeriCorps Learning Agenda 2022-2026 Innovation AmeriCorps researches and develops unique service programs that explore how to engage and improve communities. Implementation AmeriCorps members, grantees, and partner organizations adopt programs locally to address social issues. Improvement AmeriCorps leverages rigorous evaluation methods to measure program performance and identify opportunities for improvement. Expanded Impact Using evaluation results, AmeriCorps provides the framework for other organizations to replicate and scale programs in their communities. Supporting Research and Evaluation The AmeriCorps Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) produces accurate and timely research on national service, social innovation, volunteering, and civic engagement. We conduct original and sponsored research and evaluations, support evaluations of grantees\u2019 research and programs, and promote evidence-based service models \u2013 all of which infuses data into AmeriCorps programs and contributes to the public understanding of national service.
