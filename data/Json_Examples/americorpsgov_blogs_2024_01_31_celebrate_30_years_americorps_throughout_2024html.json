And we continue the celebrations. Take a sneak peek into what we planned to keep this momentum rolling in 2024. Ensuring Americans\u2019 futures are healthy and fulfilled In February, we shed light on how national service improves the physical and mental well-being of Americans. For the past 30 years, AmeriCorps has focused on our nation\u2019s healthy futures, centering around access to health care, aging in place, food security, and more. In 2022, more than 66,000 AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers supported our healthy futures for all Americans across the nation, and the agency continued to launch initiatives to meet evolving needs. AmeriCorps launched Public Health AmeriCorps with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022 to advance more equitable health outcomes, create pathways to public health careers, and rebuild our public health workforce with greater representation from the communities it serves. More than 2,600 AmeriCorps members serve in almost every state, including Guam and Puerto Rico, today, helping address their communities\u2019 immediate public health needs while advancing equity in our workforce, public health systems, and communities. AmeriCorps members serving in Public Health AmeriCorps AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers are also vital to ensuring people with disabilities and older adults can maintain independence and age with dignity. AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers serving in Senior Companion and RSVP programs help older adults with daily living tasks such as transportation to medical and other appointments, shopping or delivering meals, paying bills, and more. Not only do AmeriCorps volunteers support our nation\u2019s older adults, but they also provide respite for family caregivers. In 2020, AmeriCorps launched a new food security initiative after the nation witnessed a 55% increase in people turning to food banks and community programs. AmeriCorps members across the nation have continued to serve to end hunger by providing people power in needed programs, offering food security resources to areas most in need, and building sustainable food security systems. Within three years of the launch, more than 35,000 AmeriCorps members and volunteers have worked to address hunger and food security for 2.2 million people across the country. AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers serving at a food bank Celebrate the Millions of Members, Volunteers, and Alums AmeriCorps will celebrate the key milestone moments from the past three decades that inspire Americans to make a difference in their communities until September 2024. AmeriCorps celebrates milestones in 2024 From recruitment to environment, older adults, career pathways, and education, we shed light on memorable moments that helped bring out the best of our country. More than 200,000 AmeriCorps members, AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers, and 1.25 million alums have dedicated their time and support to transform their communities for the better.
