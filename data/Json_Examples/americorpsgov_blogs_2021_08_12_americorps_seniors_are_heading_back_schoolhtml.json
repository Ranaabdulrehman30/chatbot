AmeriCorps Seniors are preparing to provide invaluable support in the classroom as part of its Foster Grandparents program. These 55-year-old and older volunteers are choosing to stay active and engaged in retirement. They serve as mentors, tutors, and caregivers to children in schools across the country. One volunteer has created his own book club to bring about positive change in children\u2019s literacy skills. Affectionally known as \u201cGrandpa Rick,\u201d this Foster Grandparent devoted his time volunteering in two 3rd and 4th grade classrooms in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., last school year. The \u201cGrandpa Rick Book Club,\u201d hosted twice a week during student recess time, motivated kids to read books like The BFG, Hatchet, and Charlotte\u2019s Web. But it\u2019s not just about reading the books. Grandpa Rick assigned students questions to exercise their reading comprehension and led discussions about the stories. \u201cI tried my hardest to get kids enthused about reading,\u201d says Grandpa Rick. \u201cMy first book club started with five kids and over the year we grew to over a dozen.\u201d And reading scores have shot through the roof, too. Grandpa Rick is looking forward to the upcoming school year. Read more about Grandpa Rick\u2019s book club. Last school year, during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u00a0our\u00a0all-star\u00a0Foster Grandparents\u00a0continued to serve.\u00a0Some Foster Grandparents\u00a0were\u00a0pen-pals to students, some\u00a0volunteered\u00a0virtually\u00a0with students, some video-taped stories that can be played for students,\u00a0and\u00a0some made phone calls to students. In Abilene,\u00a0Texas, Grandma Judy reads\u00a0stories\u00a0to a group of 4- and 5-year-olds. However, instead of being in the same room, she was\u00a0delivering\u00a0story time\u00a0virtually.\u00a0Using tablets, volunteers\u00a0read to kids remotely,\u00a0quiz them on their schoolwork.\u00a0Judy is part of the Foster Grandparent Program that\u00a0places\u00a0senior volunteers as role models, mentors and friends to children. It's a program\u00a0hosted by \u00a0the\u00a0Texas Health and Human Services, which recently provided\u00a0tablets to 47 volunteers\u00a0to continue their service safely during the pandemic Read more about Grandma Judy and how she used technology to connect with her students. Maintaining the connection between\u00a0the students\u00a0and their Foster Grandparents\u00a0during\u00a0the pandemic was important\u00a0to\u00a0continue connecting communities and generations.\u00a0The level of care and commitment in chaos shows how AmeriCorps Seniors do so much for their communities. And while technology has kept us all close for the last year,\u00a0Foster Grandparents are\u00a0ready to go back\u00a0to school\u00a0and are\u00a0eager to help \u201ctheir kids.\u201d If you are a senior or know a senior ready to\u00a0volunteer, join us!
