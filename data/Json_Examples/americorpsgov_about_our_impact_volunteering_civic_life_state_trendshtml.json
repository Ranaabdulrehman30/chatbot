The findings below are based on data from the Current Population Survey Civic Engagement and Volunteering Supplement collected in September of 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2023. They reflect weighted state-level rates of six key measures of civic engagement: Formal Volunteering : the share of state residents who formally volunteered through organizations Informal Helping : the share of state residents who informally helped their neighbors Organizational Membership : the share of state residents who belonged to an organization Charitable Giving : the share of state residents who donated $25 or more to charity Talking with Friends and Family : the share of state residents who talked to or spent time with friends or family Talking with Neighbors : the share of state residents who had a conversation or spent time with their neighbors Formal Volunteering Toggle Formal Volunteering Rate 2017 2019 2021 2023 Alabama 27.4% 25.8% 19.5% 19.9% Alaska 40.6% 35.5%
