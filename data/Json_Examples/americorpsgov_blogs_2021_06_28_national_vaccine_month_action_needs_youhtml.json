Free shared services rides. Lots of incentives. And a month dedicated to vaccine action. The Biden Administration, in partnership with many federal agencies\u2014including AmeriCorps\u2014 corporations, and nonprofit organizations are pulling out the stops to encourage people to complete their COVID-19 vaccinations. \u201cThose wearing the AmeriCorps\u2019 \u201cA\u201d have assisted more than 2.5 million people at vaccination sites across the country\u2014they\u2019ve made a significant impact on our country\u2019s ability to vaccinate as many people as possible and recover from the pandemic,\u201d said Karen Dahl, Senior Advisor for COVID-19 at AmeriCorps. Those members are serving in communities across the country and developing innovative and accessible programs to help make getting vaccinated as easy as possible. In Maine, AmeriCorps member Will Parker, serving with the Resilience Corps at the Greater Portland Council of Governments, helped create a map showing all transit routes and vaccination sites in Maine\u2019s Cumberland and York counties. The map includes instructions on scheduling an appointment and how to get there. Community organizations are now using this tool to help those looking to get vaccinated. AmeriCorps members serving with the Conservation Trust of North Carolina and Wake County Health Department participated in a Month of Action bus tour visit and canvass in Raleigh, North Carolina with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan. At the Nashville Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency , an AmeriCorps grantee with members in the VISTA program serving, conducted a virtual COVID-19 vaccine education town hall in May and have two more planned in July. The purpose of the town hall is to educate Nashville Promise Zone residents on COVID-19 treatments as well as dispel rumors about the vaccination. Led by AmeriCorps members in the VISTA program, the Mayor\u2019s Office in New Orleans, Louisiana is planning pop-up vaccination events in target communities where vaccination rates are lower. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so much progress together\u2014united\u2014with a mission to protect the American public. I want to offer my thanks to every national service member, every volunteer, and offer my encouragement to those who haven\u2019t yet been vaccinated. Vaccines are free and available to anyone who wants one,\u201d said Dahl. Since January, with just 5 percent of Americans having received at least one vaccination, the Biden Administration has sprinted to reach its aspirational goal to have 70 percent of all Americans vaccinated by July 4. Based on today\u2019s estimates, Americans age 30 and older have reached this milestone, and those age 27 and up, are on track to meet 70 percent once the data for the July 4th holiday weekend is compiled. Visit vaccines.gov to find where to go, how to get there, and how you can help spread the word to others in your neighborhoods, networks, and friend groups. Need help finding a vaccine in the U.S.?
