This study uses self-reported survey data collected from youth in the program in Tulsa, OK\u00a0and New York City, NY\u00a0and matched comparison groups. Significant findings for program participants in Tulsa, compared to non-program students,\u00a0include: 27 percent higher rating on the program's family life and sexuality knowledge scales, and 18 percent higher on the financial literacy scale; and Two-thirds more likely to report having an eye exam and a bank account (both considered supportive positive behaviors). Significant findings for program participants in\u00a0NYC, compared to a matched comparison dataset,\u00a0include: 7 percent less likely to report having been pregnant/causing a pregnancy; 18-33 percent\u00a0more likely to report using a condom at last intercourse; 15-20 percent\u00a0less likely to report smoking cigarettes; 9-16 percent less likely reporting smoking marijuana in the past 30 days; and 13-16 percent less likely to report having been in a physical fight in the past 12 months. Because of the limitations of this study in NYC with\u00a0matching comparison data and the underpowered sample sizes in Tulsa, this research is at best suggestive of the model\u2019s potential and additional study is recommended to better measure the effectiveness of the in-school version of the CAS-Carrera program model.
