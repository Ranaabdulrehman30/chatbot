It's a Movement. Three decades ago, more than 20,000 Americans raised their right hands and pledged to get things done for America. These members helped more than 1,000 communities nationwide during their first year of service. Since then, more than 1.3 million Americans and hundreds of thousands more AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers of all backgrounds have followed in their footsteps, providing billions of hours of results-driven service across each of the 50 states and US territories. In times of tragedy and triumph, when America calls, AmeriCorps answers. Whether it\u2019s AmeriCorps members stepping forward to help after 9/11, aiding in recovery from disasters like Hurricane Katrina over the course of decades, or pivoting to address the urgent needs created by the COVID-19 pandemic, AmeriCorps knows how to get things done for America and has been turning moments of impact into a national service movement throughout the years.
