In each of these locations, AmeriCorps members stand alongside neighbors and community leaders responding to COVID-19, just as they are across the country. AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers are on the ground, delivering aid where it\u2019s needed, and helping vaccinate thousands throughout Florida. Speaking to a group of local leaders during a visit to Feeding Northeast Florida\u2019s warehouse, Vice President Harris stated , \u201cThe work you all have been doing is extraordinary. I'm certain that history is going to show that this was a moment of extreme crisis that challenged us, and there were the heroes that just showed up.\u201d At AmeriCorps, we share that same belief. We know that not all heroes wear capes. Sometimes they wear an \u201cA.\u201d Reducing Hunger and Strengthening Food Systems Joined by Secretary Tom Vilsack, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff visited the Food Bank of Iowa , one of the many AmeriCorps partners working to improve food insecurity. While Mr. Emhoff didn\u2019t get the opportunity to meet any AmeriCorps members, the work matters no less. For the past year, just as millions have faced increasing hunger needs, volunteers have been a part of the critical part of the response to ensure that every American is able to put food on the table. AmeriCorps has joined this effort, with teams supporting food banks and other hunger programs across the country. Spring partnership announced with Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, McLennan County Hunger Coalition Ohio National Guard transitions out; AmeriCorps in at Greater Cleveland Food Bank Feeding Washington: Facing food insecurity head on Iowa AmeriCorps Site Tackling Food Insecurity Receives VIP Visit Supporting Vaccination Outreach and Delivery In recent months, AmeriCorps has joined the urgent campaign to vaccinate as many Americans as possible. Hundreds of AmeriCorps members are providing the extra people power to increase the capacity of state, local, and FEMA supported centers. Vice President Kamala Harris stopped by one of these centers in Jacksonville, Fla. where she said a few brief words to the Naval Officers and AmeriCorps members supporting the center: \u201cThat\u2019s some of the most noble work any human being can do: to live a life of service. To protect, to support, and to lift up our neighbors. That\u2019s what you guys are doing. So, I\u2019m here on behalf of the President and myself to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
