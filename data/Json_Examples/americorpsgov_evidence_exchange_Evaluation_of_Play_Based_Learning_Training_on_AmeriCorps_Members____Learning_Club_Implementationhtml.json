This program\u2019s mission is to ensure children have access to the learning that happens at the Museum. The Learning Clubs use STEAM activities and play-based learning to strengthen kids\u2019 number sense and measurement skills. Study Goals : The goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of members\u2019 training to learn if the training successfully prepared members to implement play-based learning strategies within their Learning Club programs, thereby improving their likelihood to affect positive child outcomes. Research Questions : The research questions were: To what extent are members receiving the required training to effectively implement play-based learning theory in their programs? To what extent is the Learning Club curriculum, which includes play-based learning, being implemented at each site with the intended program beneficiaries at the intended dosage? To what extent has the Learning Club experience improved children\u2019s mathematics skills/understanding? Findings: The findings that were found include: Surveys show that both before and after training, all but one member had a high understanding of play-based learning when asked to categorize the descriptors on the survey (e.g., is open-ended, has multiple entry points, etc.). As a result, no knowledge development was documented by this measurement. There was an increase of words associated with a conceptual and practical understanding of play and play-based learning from pre to post survey \u2013 with child-directed (play) and child-centered (play-based learning) vocabulary demonstrating the most growth. Questions that showed limited growth were members\u2019 comfort in working with 2nd-4th graders, the ease of bringing play-based learning into a formal learning environment, and their confidence in facilitating play-based learning lessons. Though pre/post development was not quantified through the categorization of play-based learning descriptors, growth was clear in members\u2019 written definitions of play and play-based learning. Their definitions showed a richer, more articulate understanding of the Museum\u2019s play theory. Overall, members demonstrated growth in their Learning Club implementation from their first to second observation. For more information, download the f ull report.
