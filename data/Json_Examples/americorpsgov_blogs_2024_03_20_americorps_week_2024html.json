In recognition of their service, from March 10-16, we celebrated the 1.3 million individuals who have stood with us for three decades as part of the annual AmeriCorps Week celebration. AmeriCorps Week 2024 AmeriCorps members, staff, alums, and\u00a0elected officials sounded off from across the country. Together, we recognized the more than 200,000 AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers from all walks of life who choose to turn their determination, compassion, and creativity into practical solutions for neighbors and strangers alike. Check out how we made this AmeriCorps Week one for the books: AmeriCorps members and alumni showed off their AmeriCorps pride during Day of the A, sharing their own stories on social media, and showcasing how they make a difference in their community. AmeriCorps members poked a little lighthearted fun at their AmeriCorps habits by jumping on the \u201cof course\u201d trend. View this post on Instagram A post shared by AmeriCorps (@americorps) AmeriCorps NCCC Director and Peace Corps Alum, Ken Goodson, shared how his commitment to service started as a young adult, and how it helps him lead our NCCC program for 18-26-year-olds, transforming communities and their lives. Read how Ken kicked off the week: Bit.ly/ACWKen24 We also heard how the service journey started for AmeriCorps member Jonah. At the age of five, he witnessed the power of service as an honorary AmeriCorps member and the son of AmeriCorps Monitoring Officer Beth, then deputy director for City Year Columbia , as he joined her at service sites. Eighteen years later, Jonah became an official AmeriCorps member with American Connection Corps . Check out how he continues to make a difference: Bit.ly/ACWJonah On Day of the A, our Ameri-Family showed off their AmeriCorps\u00a0\ud83c\udd70 with craft projects, their favorite gear, and more! From the old AmeriCorps logo to the new, we saw their creativity unfold and saw why they\u2019re proud to get things done for America. Happy #DayOfTheA ! Show off your #AmeriCorps \ud83c\udd70 with craft projects, you in your gear, or even doing a dance. Get creative and share why you\u2019re proud to serve and we\u2019ll feature you in this thread. \u2b07\ufe0f #AmeriPride #AmeriCorpsWeek #AmeriCorps30 pic.twitter.com/6NNyieXwPC \u2014 AmeriCorps (@AmeriCorps) March 14, 2024 From coast to coast, governors, mayors, and elected officials of all backgrounds united in recognition of the AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers, past and present, for their outstanding service to their communities.
