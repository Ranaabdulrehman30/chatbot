Every day. For decades, AmeriCorps has served as a leader in addressing the nation\u2019s 21st century environmental challenges. Each year, the agency and its partners engage more than 16,000 members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers in conservation, renewable energy, and community-resilience programs to help offset the impacts from changes to our climate. And this year is no different. On Friday, April 22, the 52nd anniversary of Earth Day, AmeriCorps members around the country will continue to step up to meet the environmental needs of their communities. With the effects of climate change becoming a global threat, research shows that the future of our planet is at risk. New records of rising temperatures, extreme weather conditions, ocean acidification, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels are being broken regularly. Water, air, and land pollution pose daily threats to our health, ecosystems, and climate. Low-income communities are already more likely to have a variety of health problems, are more exposed to environmental hazards and take longer to recover from natural disasters. According to the Sixth National Climate Assessment, these communities are hit the hardest by the effects of this damage to our planet. Mt. Adams Institute The Mt. Adams Institute\u2019s mission is to strengthen the connection between people and the natural world through education, service learning, career development, and research. Some national service projects include wildfire landscape management, trail maintenance and construction, invasive species mitigation and wildlife impact surveys, environment education, and volunteer coordination. In the photo above, VetsWork members complete a group service project. Civic Works Baltimore Civic Works strengthens Baltimore\u2019s communities through education, skills development, and community service, helping create a\u00a0more sustainable, economically viable, and environmentally responsible community. So far, they have grown 200,000 pounds of fresh produce and planted more than 25,000 trees. Additionally, Civic Works Community Lot teams transform vacant and abandoned lots in Baltimore City into green spaces, removing impermeable surfaces that contribute to flood management problems to replace them with permeable community spaces. Civic Works AmeriCorps members also help thousands of Baltimore families reduce energy use and save on utility bills by conducting in-home energy assessments; installing free or low-cost energy efficiency upgrades including LED lighting, insulation, and air sealing; and educating residents on ways to save energy. In the photo above, Baltimore Conservation Leadership Corps members are at work to improve their parks and gardens. Gulf Coast Oyster Corps Gulf Coast Oyster Corps is a training academy based within Conservation Corps of the Forgotten and Emerald Coasts where members work to restore oyster habitats, strengthen coastal resilience, and drive economic diversification through aquaculture.\u00a0 In the photo above, AmeriCorps members propagate native marsh grasses in the Florida Panhandle.
