AmeriCorps\u2019 2023 Resolutions Celebrate the millions of Americans who strengthen our nation\u2019s civic engagement every day \ufe0f In January, AmeriCorps released the Volunteering and Civic Life in America research to highlight the millions of individuals who make a significant impact on the world around them. The research shows that 60.7 million Americans volunteered more than 4.1 billion hours of service between September 2020 and 2021 , even during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together with US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith, Boys & Girls Club of America , Feeding America , and Communities In Schools , we explored how Americans helped bridge divides, the importance of volunteering to combat isolation and loneliness, and how to further strengthen our communities through service. Provide service pathways to help create sustainable and healthy communities across the country In 2023, more than 2,340 AmeriCorps members served in the VISTA Summer Associates program, an opportunity for Americans to serve on a short-term basis and engage in a current project for eight to ten weeks, beginning in May. Summer associates united in the mission to alleviate poverty in 2023, served alongside full-time AmeriCorps members in the VISTA program, and supported more than 165 service projects in 720 service sites in 48 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Summer associates serving at Skagit County Public Hospital District 304 in Washington State helped reach out to more than 300 people with information about substance misuse and overdose prevention. Summer associates serving in 2023 Summer Associates created connections with people of all ages and gave out lifesaving materials such as locking medication storage containers and naloxone, the medication that temporarily reverses an opioid overdose. Support disaster recovery efforts after natural disasters from coast to coast From Florida to Hawaii, our nation and territories\u2019 communities faced devastating natural disasters in 2023. Hawaii was hit by a series of wildfires in early August that caused extensive damage and resulted in the death of at least 115 people in Lahaina, making this the deadliest wildfire in modern US history. Days after, AmeriCorps deployed 40 members, like Michael, to begin disaster recovery efforts, supporting volunteer and donations management.

The strongest hurricane to make landfall in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region in more than 125 years. AmeriCorps deployed more than 60 members and staff to help. Our members assisted with tree removal, temporary roof repair, debris removal, mold suppression, and muck and gut services. Create new pathways to expand service opportunities and address our nation\u2019s most pressing needs On September 20, 2023, AmeriCorps celebrated a new conversation legacy launched by President Biden \u2013 the AmeriCorps NCCC Forest Corps . In partnership with the US Forest Service, the new initiative will help improve the lives of individuals and communities nationwide while helping the nation address climate change's catastrophic and disproportionate impacts and unequal access to training, higher education, and high-quality jobs. View this post on Instagram A post shared by AmeriCorps NCCC (@americorpsnccc) AmeriCorps also joined forces with the Departments of Commerce, the Interior, Agriculture, Labor and Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency to out the mission, goals, priorities, and next steps for implementing President Biden\u2019s American Climate Corps under a Memorandum of Understanding . Celebrate 30 years of AmeriCorps From Hollywood actors to political figures and grassroots activists, the nation came together in September and October 2023 to celebrate AmeriCorps\u2019 30th anniversary . AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith presenting President Clinton with AmeriCorps\u2019 letterman jacket Hundreds of Americans joined our nation\u2019s leaders and AmeriCorps leaders, members, AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers, and alums in a virtual event commemorating the 30th anniversary . AmeriCorps CEO was joined by our board member Shirley Sagawa, The King Center CEO Dr. Bernice A. King, Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser, Senator Chris Coons, and a special shoutout from AmeriCorps alum turned actor Jay Ellis. A month later, we joined the AmeriCorps: 30 Years Forward S ummit hosted by the Clinton Center . Alongside President Clinton, national service champions, leaders in the public and private sectors, and AmeriCorps alums and members, we discussed our greatest milestones and the future of service. Our Movement Continues We\u2019re grateful to our members, AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers, alums, grantees, partners, and champions who continue to help us meet our New Year\u2019s resolutions and strengthen national service across our country.
