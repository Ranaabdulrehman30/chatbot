That is why AmeriCorps has joined with MTV Entertainment and more than 1,000 partner organizations in the first-ever Mental Health Action Day on Thursday, May 20. Over the past two decades, suicide rates have risen, particularly among young adults. And the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the already dire crisis, giving way to what many mental health professionals have called the \u201csecond pandemic.\u201d Though more people than ever are comfortable discussing mental health, finding effective resources and knowing how to get help remains a challenge.\u00a0Mental Health Action Day is an open-source movement of brands, organizations, and cultural leaders to drive our society from mental health awareness to mental health action. Many people fall through the cracks in the space between awareness and action\u2014particularly those who have been marginalized or underserved by existing institutions. I encourage the national service community\u2014whether for themselves, for their loved ones or others\u2014to share these resources far and wide in your networks and on your social channels. More information on mental health and resources are available from National Institute for Mental Health and Mental Health Action Day . Join with AmeriCorps, MTV, and hundreds of other organizations to spotlight the importance of prioritizing our mental health. I know our community knows how to #GetThingsDone.
