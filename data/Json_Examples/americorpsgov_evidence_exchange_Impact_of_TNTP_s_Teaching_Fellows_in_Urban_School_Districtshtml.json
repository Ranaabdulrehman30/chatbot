The Teaching Fellows program is an alternative to university-based teacher preparation. It was designed to provide urban partner districts with qualified new teachers to improve low student achievement. Study Goals : The evaluation explored program impacts that focused on student achievement and teacher instructional practice outcomes in year 2 of teaching. Research Questions : The primary research questions were: Do students taught by Fellows demonstrate higher academic achievement compared to students taught by comparable teachers? Do Fellows demonstrate more effective classroom instructional practice compared to similar teachers? Findings: The evaluation found the following: Students taught by Fellows performed similarly to students taught by comparable teachers. Fellows demonstrated similar classroom instructional practice to comparable teachers. For more information, download the full report .
